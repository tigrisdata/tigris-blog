**Whole bucket snapshots, like git tags for your bucket**

Sometimes you wish you could go back in time with your data after things go
wrong. Say the incorrect data got deleted, or your model started promising to
[sell a car for $1](https://www.upworthy.com/prankster-tricks-a-gm-dealership-chatbot-to-sell-him-a-76000-chevy-tahoe-for-ex1)
and you need to figure out which data led to that unexpected behavior. Can you
go back in time to see how things were so you can figure out where it all went
wrong? Snapshots enable this– they've been a core component of resilient system
design since the 60s, and they're finally making it to object storage.

With Tigris, you can snapshot a point in time for your whole bucket. Not just
individual object versions. The same way you'd `git tag` a release, you can name
your snapshot with a meaningful version and reference it from other tools. And a
snapshot can seed a
[fork](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/fork-buckets-like-code/), an instant,
isolated copy of a bucket. As far as we can tell, Tigris is the only object
storage system to offer this as a feature.

## Why snapshots matter

Object storage has been thought of as a backup target– databases, VMs, volumes,
registries, and even entire datacenters can be snapshotted and backed up to
object storage. But what about snapshotting object storage itself? More and more
systems, especially cloud native ones, use object storage as the primary data
store. It's simpler, and it fits the shape of the data: increasingly
unstructured and multi modal.

If object storage is the primary data store, it needs safety features like
snapshots. S3's object versioning got us close, but recovery and versioning are
limited to single objects. Stitching together the state of a bucket at a point
in time has required touching each object and hoping for consistency. It takes a
whole bucket snapshot to provide reproducibility, version control, and insurance
against mistakes.

## Version control built directly into object storage

Here's what's cool: snapshots work for datasets that don't fit into existing
data version management tools. Think of extremely large, frequently changing
datasets such as:

- Raw clickstreams
- Event logs
- Batch-appended training logs
- Video streams
- Kafka message streams
- Real time inference logs

Anything that's large and changes frequently is tough for traditional tools to
version. And we as an industry are increasingly feeding live data into our
systems in a way that can meaningfully change the outputs of our models.

It's lightweight version control for _all_ of your data.

## Whole environments, cloned instantly

Developer sandboxes, AI agent environments, load testing with real production
data, feature-branch test environments– all of these spin up faster and more
consistently from a snapshot.

Need to
[experiment on massive datasets without the risk of hurting the data](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/dataset-experimentation/)
if things go wrong? Put it in a bucket and fork it. Many digital hands make
light work!

Want to spin up an instance of an AI agent quickly? Store all its dependencies
in a snapshot, and make a forked bucket from the snapshot on launch. Your agent
has everything it needs without moving data around.

## How to use snapshots

You can create a snapshot enabled bucket in the Tigris Console, and then create
a snapshot in it.

<center style={{ marginLeft: "auto", marginRight: "auto" }}>
  <img
    src={bucketSnapshotDemo}
    class="animation"
    style={{ maxWidth: "40rem", minWidth: "12rem" }}
    alt="A demo of creating a snapshot in the Tigris Console."
  />
</center>

You can also do this from the
[Tigris SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdks/tigris/):

```js
import { createBucketSnapshot } from "@tigrisdata/storage";
import styles from "!!raw-loader!./styles.css";

<style>{styles}</style>;

const { data, error } = await createBucketSnapshot();

if (error) {
  console.error("Error creating snapshot:", error);
} else {
  console.log("Snapshot created:", data);
  // output: { snapshotVersion: "1751631910169675092" }
}
```

## Conclusion

Snapshots have been around since the 60s. The first snapshots were for the CPU
registers, memory, and device state of mainframes. And then in the 80s, database
checkpoints enabled atomic rollbacks and crash recovery. In the 90s, we got
filesystem level snapshots with ZFS and LVM. And then in the 2000s with the rise
of virtualization, we adopted snapshotting at the image layer. But we haven't
had object storage level snapshots until now.

Whole bucket snapshots are a big deal because they extend snapshot semantics,
normally limited to filesystems, block volumes, or individual objects, to an
entire object storage namespace. The functionality is similar to what's come
before, but the way it's implemented is new. Read more in the
[deep dive on how we built snapshots](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/bucket-forking-deep-dive/).
Spoiler: snapshots are essentially free because Tigris uses an append only log.

Get your entire bucket of objects, all versioned together. Only on Tigris.
