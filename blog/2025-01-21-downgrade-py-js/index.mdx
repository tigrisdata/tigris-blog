Hey all. Recently AWS released
[boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)
version 1.36.0, and in the process they changed how the `upload_file` call
works. This will cause uploads to Tigris with boto3 version 1.36.0 or higher to
fail with the following error message:

```
boto3.exceptions.S3UploadFailedError: Failed to upload ./filename.jpg to mybucket/filename.jpg: An error occurred (MissingContentLength) when calling the PutObject operation: You must provide the Content-Length HTTP header.
```

In order to work around this, downgrade boto3 to the last release of version
1.35.x:

```sh
pip install boto3==1.35.95
```

Make sure that you persist this in your `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or
whatever you use to do dependency management.

You might also hit this with the JavaScript client at version
[v3.729.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/issues/6810) or later. In order
to fix that, downgrade to version
[v3.728.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/releases/tag/v3.728.0):

```sh
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3@3.728.0
npm install @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner@3.728.0
```

Make sure the changes are saved in your package.json file.

We’re fixing this on our end, but we want to take a minute to clarify why this
is happening and what it means for Tigris to be S3 compatible.

## What does it mean to be S3 compatible?

At some level, an API is just a set of calls that have listed side effects. You
upload an object by name and later are able to get that object back when you
give the name. The devil is in the details, and like any good API there are a
lot of details.

In a perfect world, when you switch to using Tigris, you drop Tigris into place
and then you don’t need to think anymore. We don’t live in a perfect world, and
as such Tigris has a
[list of compatible API calls](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/api/s3/), and if
your app only uses those calls you’ll be fine. Most apps are perfectly happy
with that set of calls (in fact only use about 5 of them at most). We are adding
support for any missing calls as reality demands and time allows. Our goal is
that there’s no breaking changes when anything else gets released. Client or
server.

S3’s API was originally meant to be used with Amazon S3. It has since become a
cross-cloud standard, any cloud you can think of likely has a S3-compatible
object storage system. It’s become the POSIX abstraction for the cloud. Any
changes to the API change a whole host of edge cases that the creators of S3
probably don’t have in mind.

Tigris, Digital Ocean, MinIO, R2, and others were all affected by this change.
We found out about this breakage when one of our tests broke in a new and
exciting way that confused us. From what we can tell, users of boto3 and the
JavaScript client found out about this change by their production code breaking
without warning. Even some of AWS’ own example code broke with this change.

I feel bad for the team behind the S3 API changes, they’re probably not getting
very much love from the developer community right now. If this was an outage,
I’d say
[#hugops](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/supporting-your-sysadmins-with-hugops).
I’m not sure what to say this time other than I hope that this post helps you
make your code work again.

We’re taking this incident seriously and are updating our testing practices to
make sure that we have more advance warning should this happen again as we take
S3 compatibility seriously.

We’re updating Tigris so that developers can use this new version of the S3
client. We’ll have that rolled out soon. Follow us on
