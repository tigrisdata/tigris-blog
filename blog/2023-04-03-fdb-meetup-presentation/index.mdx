# A developer-driven approach to building secondary indexes

I did a presentation at the
[FoundationDB Monthly Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/foundationdb-online-meetup/).
The talk is about, how building secondary indexes for a database is always about
balance. A balance between a system that scales and is easy to manage and an API
that is intuitive and delightful for a developer to use. Recently at Tigris
Data, we have been adding secondary indexes to our metadata store and have been
working hard to achieve a good balance between scale and developer delight.
Tigris is a storage platform that leverages FoundationDB as one of its core
components. In this talk I cover four aspects we had to balance:

1. Handling schema changes automatically in our secondary indexes.
2. The trade-off between auto-indexing all fields and indexing select fields.
3. Changes we made after performance testing.
4. How we plan build indexes in the background with minimal conflicts.
