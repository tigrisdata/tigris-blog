# A developer-driven approach to building secondary indexes

I did a presentation at the [FoundationDB Monthly Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/foundationdb-online-meetup/).
The talk is about, how building secondary indexes for a database is always about balance.
A balance between a system that scales and is easy to manage and an API that is intuitive and delightful for a developer to use.
Recently at Tigris Data, we have been adding secondary indexes to our database and have been working hard to achieve a good balance between scale and developer delight.
Tigris is a transactional document database that runs on top of FoundationDB and is compatible with MongoDB.
In this talk I cover four aspects we had to balance:1. Handling schema changes automatically
in our secondary indexes so that users don't have to worry about it.

1. The trade-off between auto-indexing all fields and indexing select fields.
2. Changes we made after performance testing.
3. How we plan build indexes in the background with minimal conflicts.
