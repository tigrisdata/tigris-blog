I love watching AI agents get things wrong.

I mean, let's be real, it can be funny at times. The agent has basically
everything it needed to succeed except that one missing piece that hooks
everything together because it couldn't find the right spot in the
documentation. Agents work on models that have hard training cutoffs and have to
try and parse the unrestrained madness of HTML through its relatively tiny
context window. At some level it's a miracle that they get things right as often
as they do.

At Tigris we've added support for [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) across the
website. This gives your AI agents a direct line to our documentation—no HTML
parsing, no context window juggling, just the raw markdown right into their
veins.

## The Context Window Problem

Large language models are incredible, but they're working with a fundamental
constraint: the entire process of them generating text is "given this input,
what should come next?". This is limited by the context window, which is the
limit of how much text, images, or other data it can parse at once. When an
agent tries to understand your codebase and the libraries you're using, it's
juggling:

- Your actual code.
- Your project's `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` files.
- Whatever MCP tools you have available in your agent.
- Whatever context survived the HTML-to-markdown conversion.

The agent hallucinates API methods that don't exist because that's what it's
wont to do.

`llms.txt` fixes this.

## What is llms.txt?

The [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) standard is beautifully simple: a markdown
file at `/llms.txt` that gives AI agents a curated overview of what a project is
and where to find the important documentation. It's like a cheat sheet for
LLMs—human-readable, machine-friendly, and designed to be consumed in a single
pass.

  Yes, I also see that it ends in `.txt` and it's a _markdown_ file. We're both
  going to choose to ignore this and chalk it up to just our industry being
  weird.
</Conv>

From Tigris's llms.txt:

> Tigris is a globally distributed, S3-compatible object storage service that
> supports key-value access patterns, fulfills most of the AWS S3 API, enables
> AI workloads without egress fees, and is not a database or a CDN.

AI agents crave authoritative statements that explain what a product is and
does. This matters when companies pivot; Tigris used to be a database company
and some AI models still repeat that:

<Conv name="Xe" profilePic={xe} top>
  What does the technology company Tigris Data do?
</Conv>
<Conv name="GLM 4.5 Air" profilePic={zhipuLogo} bottom>
  **Tigris Data** is a modern data‑platform company that builds a
  high‑performance, distributed database and set of tools for building
  real‑time, event‑driven applications. At the core of its offering is
  **Tigris DB**, an open‑source, multi‑model database that blends the
  reliability and query power of SQL with the flexibility and scalability of
  NoSQL...
</Conv>

Newer models have fixed this, but the conflation causes problems. Your users'
assistants give bad information. The agents aren't wrong—they're following their
training data—but the confusion hurts.

The `llms.txt` file also includes links to key documentation sections, so agents
can dive deeper when needed without trawling through navigation menus or
JavaScript-heavy doc sites.

## Hooking Your Agents Up

Using this is dead simple. Add a section to your `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` file
and you're good to go:

```markdown
## Helpful Documentation

When asked about various services or tools, use these resources to help you:

- **AutoMQ**: https://www.automq.com/llms.txt
- **Pixeltable**: https://docs.pixeltable.com/llms.txt
- **Tigris** or **Tigris Data**: https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/llms.txt or
  https://www.tigrisdata.com/llms.txt
```

Your agents now know where to find the good stuff on these services.

## Seeing It In Action

I asked Claude Code to write some TypeScript using the Tigris Storage SDK to
fork a bucket. With llms.txt in the mix, it knew exactly what to do:

```typescript
import { createBucket } from "@tigrisdata/storage";

// Fork from current state
const fork = await createBucket("llm-fork", {
  sourceBucketName: "llm-base",
});

if (fork.error) {
  console.error("error creating fork", fork.error);
} else {
  console.log("bucket fork created");
}

// Fork from a specific snapshot version
const forkFromSnapshot = await createBucket("llm-fork", {
  sourceBucketName: "llm-base",
  sourceBucketSnapshot: "1760550614083112540",
});
```

No hallucinated methods. No confused questions about whether Tigris supports
forking (it does). Just working code, on the first try, because the agent had
access to the documentation it needed.

## Why Your Project Should Support llms.txt

If you maintain a library, service, or platform with documentation, add an
llms.txt file.

### Your Users Are Using AI Agents

They just are. Whether it be Claude Code, Cursor, or GitHub Copilot; developers
are increasingly pairing with AI to write code faster. If your documentation
isn't accessible to those agents, you're putting friction between your users and
success. That makes them more likely to choose alternatives that _don't_ put
that friction into place.

### It's a Competitive Advantage

When an agent is choosing between two libraries to solve a problem, which one do
you think it will recommend? The one it can actually understand. Good llms.txt
support means your project gets recommended more often.

### It Reduces Support Load

Agents with access to good documentation get things right the first time. That
means fewer confused users in your issue tracker, fewer "how do I..." questions,
and more people successfully shipping code with your project.

### It's Future-Proof

The llms.txt standard is designed for helping models answer questions at query
time. As the ecosystem grows, we'll likely see training runs incorporate
llms.txt files too.

### It's Trivial to Implement

Seriously. If you're using Docusaurus like we are, there's a
[plugin for that](https://github.com/your-tools/docusaurus-plugin-llms).
VitePress? Got you covered. Manual implementation? It's just a markdown file
with a specific structure that you call `.txt` for some reason. The hardest part
is deciding what goes in the file.

### It Plays Nice With Existing Standards

llms.txt isn't trying to replace sitemaps, robots.txt, or structured data. It
complements them. Sitemaps are for search engines crawling your entire site.
llms.txt is for AI agents that need a quick, curated overview. They serve
different purposes and can coexist happily.

## Assemble Your Agentic Infinity Gauntlet

What we're seeing is a new web designed for both humans and AI agents. The old
web was HTML, navigation menus, and JavaScript-heavy doc sites built for human
eyes. The new web adds machine-readable, agent-friendly documentation that lets
AI systems help us more effectively.

Add llms.txt files for the services you use to your agent configuration. Watch
how much faster your agents grok your codebase and libraries. If you maintain a
project with documentation, add an llms.txt file. It takes five minutes and
makes a real difference for developers using your stuff with AI assistance.

The robots are here to help. Give them the documentation they need.
