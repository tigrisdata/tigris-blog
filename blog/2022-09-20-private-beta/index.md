## Join the Tigris waitlist and be the first to try the new open-source developer data platform for your next application

![Complexity to Simplicity with Tigris](./light-bulb.png)

Over the past year, we’ve been building a revolutionary new data platform for
developers to handle all their applications’ data needs without all the data
infrastructure complexity. This is the first truly open source developer data
platform available with a simple yet powerful, unified API that spans search,
event streaming, and transactional document store. It enables you to focus on
building your applications and stop worrying about the data infrastructure.

Today we are opening up the waitlist for you to join our beta program. Tigris
is focused on the needs of the developer community and committed to delivering
a solution that addresses the unique needs of developers in a data driven
environment. The best way for us to build a better platform is to work with
our users on a daily basis.

If you are interested in helping us out please add yourself to our waitlist
[here](https://www.tigrisdata.com/beta). We will be providing access to the
platform on a rolling basis in the coming weeks.

## Why we created Tigris?

While working on the database platforms for companies like Uber, Percona and
other startups, we noticed a common problem - **Developers are held back by
their databases**.

Building modern cloud native applications often requires you to bolt on systems
and infrastructure components to overcome the shortcomings of your data
infrastructure that were never designed to operate in the modern ecosystem.

This means more tools to manage and deploy, and infrastructure complexity that
distracts you from building your applications.

This cost of maintaining multiple different systems is not only expensive but
is disruptive to development time. Time has become an extremely limited resource
for developers. The more complex the environment, the more time is spent
troubleshooting, learning new database languages, and maintaining various
systems, instead of shipping features and building applications.

This is exactly why we built Tigris. Now developers will spend less time on
tedious infrastructure management and more time on what they do best - coding
and feature development.

## Features to simplify your workflow

1. **Simple APIs:** Quickly add data and easily retrieve or edit that data through simple and intuitive APIs.
2. **Flexible Document Model:** Our JSON data structure makes it easy to map to the objects in your code while providing the schema enforcement seen in traditional databases. Furthermore, its flexibility makes it easy to evolve your data models.
3. **Zero Cost Schema Evolution:** Schemas evolve in a lightweight manner without any downtime. Changes are performed in a transactional manner, take only a few milliseconds to complete and do not require a collection rebuild.
4. **Automatic Index Maintenance & Management:** The system makes query tuning a thing of the past with automatic index management and maintenance, meaning you will never have to worry about slow queries due to missing indexes.
5. **Transactions:** Strictly serializable isolation, and unlike some other document databases, no confusing read / write concerns to configure, and no cross-shard caveats.
6. **Event Streaming:** Built-in event streaming allows you to subscribe and publish events using the same API you use to query and search data. Since data is automatically indexed, you can query all data and search through all events with ease.
7. **Global Search:** Search across all your collections using full text or faceted search. All with an integrated search engine that eliminates the need to run a separate search platform and synchronize data.
8. **Cloud Native Architecture:** Built as individual components that can be scaled independently to keep performance and scalability high while keeping costs low. Core data storage is built on FoundationDB, a distributed backend that enables nearly limitless scalability.
9. **Open Source:** Tigris is truly open source, adhering to an Apache 2 license. Built on open source principles we’re committed to providing a secure, stable, and innovative product.
10. **Multi-tenant by default:** Save on investment costs and maximize resource usage. Multi-tenancy provides the much needed flexibility to add new customers and applications quickly and easily.
