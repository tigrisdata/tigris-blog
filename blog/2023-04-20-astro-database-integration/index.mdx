import tigrisConfig from "@site/tigris.config.js";

[Astro](https://astro.build/) bills itself as "the all-in-one web framework
designed for speed," allowing you to "pull your content from anywhere." Their
integration ecosystem helps you build performant, accessible, and SEO-friendly
sites. Having built several sites with Astro, I can attest to the breadth of
options to get your site up and running quickly.

But there was one noticeable gap in the ecosystem: database access. This is
understandable because most Astro sites are built to be static. That's not to
say you couldn't use a database with an Astro site, but it lacked the ease of
use that their other integrations provide.

[![Tigris loves Astro](./astro-tigris-integration.png)](/blog/astro-database-integration/)

That's why we're excited to announce the official Tigris integration
([@tigrisdata/astro](https://npmjs.org/package/@tigrisdata/astro)) for Astro.
This integration allows you to use Tigris as your database, and pull your data
into your Astro site. This means you can build a static site with Astro, and use
Tigris to power your content.

## How to use the Tigris integration for Astro

The Tigris integration for Astro is available on npm. To install it, run:

```bash
npm install @tigrisdata/astro
```

Once installed, you'll need to configure your Tigris connection in your
`astro.config.mjs` file. An example is shown below:

```ts title=astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import tigris from "@tigrisdata/astro";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    tigris({
      branch: "main",
      projectName: "YOUR_TIGRIS_PROJECT_NAME",
      clientId: "YOUR_TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID",
      clientSecret: "YOUR_TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET",
    }),
  ],
});
```

:::tip

If you add the following environment variables, the config options aren't
required in the astro.config.mjs:

- TIGRIS_PROJECT
- TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID
- TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET
- TIGRIS_DB_BRANCH

:::

### Get hooked on data

Once the integration is configured, you can use the `useTigrisCollection` hook
to perform CRUD operations on your Tigris Data collections.

```tsx
---
import { useTigrisCollection } from "@tigrisdata/astro";

class Comment {
  id: string;
  slug: string;
  name: string;
  message: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}

const { slug } = Astro.props;

const commentCollection = await useTigrisCollection<Comment>("comments");
const postCommentsCursor = await commentCollection.findMany({
  filter: { slug },
  sort: [{ field: "createdAt", order: "$desc" }],
});

const comments = await postCommentsCursor.toArray();
---

  {
    comments.map((comment) => {
      return (
        <div class="comment" id={`comment${comment.id}`}>
          <p>{comment.message}</p>
          <h4>{comment.name}</h4>
          <time>{new Date(comment.createdAt).toLocaleString()}</time>
        </div>
      );
    })
  }
```

:::info **Did you see that!?**

That code not only pulled data from a "comments" collection but also did it in a
type-safe way. That's right! Even though Tigris is a NoSQL database, your data
can still be typed and validated.

## What could I build with Tigris and Astro?

The short answer is "don't let your dreams be dreams." 😁 The long answer is the
possibilities are nearly endless. Here are a few ideas (and a sample app) to get
you started:

- Product reviews & ratings
- Traffic analytics
- User profiles
- Blog comments

Hey, speaking of blog comments, let's see how it could be done.

### Blog comments with Tigris and Astro

I won't go through all the steps to add blog comments to your site, because I
already covered it in a
[sample repo on GitHub](https://github.com/tigrisdata-community/astro-comments).

Basically, I used the base Astro blog template and added:

- A `Comments` component to add on each blog post to render comments for the
  post
- A `NewComment` component that displays an HTML form that submits to a Netlify
  function
- A `newcomment` Netlify function that adds the comment to the Tigris collection

:::info See it in action

You can see a live demo of the app at https://papaya-llama-a9697a.netlify.app/

### Hey! Where are my comments?

Great question! That's because the Astro site is static. The next time the site
is built, the comments will appear. Of course, you'll probably want to moderate
submissions to ensure they're not spam. Speaking of...

## Next steps

There are several things we could add to the sample app, like:

- Adding a honeypot to the `NewComment` component to help prevent spam
- Add error checking in the `newcomment.ts` function
- Adding comment counts to the blog post list

If you have additional ideas or want to tackle one of these, jump on over to the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/tigrisdata-community/astro-comments) and submit
a PR. We'd love to see what you come up with.

what you think of the Astro integration.

Tigris is an open source serverless NoSQL database and search platform. If you
