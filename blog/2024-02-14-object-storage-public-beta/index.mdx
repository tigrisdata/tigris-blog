# Tigris, the globally distributed S3-compatible object storage

Hello, world! We're Tigris Data, and today we're announcing the public beta of
Tigris. Tigris is a globally distributed object storage service that provides
low latency anywhere in the world, enabling developers like you to store and
access any amount of data using the S3 libraries you're already using in
production. Today, we're launching our public beta on top of Fly.io.

## The backstory

Before founding Tigris, my co-founders Himank, Yevgeniy, and I spearheaded the
storage platform teams at Uber. Over six years, we built and operated Uber's
global storage infrastructure, supporting millions of users per day across the
Uber Rides and Uber Eats apps.

Our projects, such as
[Docstore](https://www.uber.com/en-US/blog/schemaless-sql-database/),
[Herb](https://www.uber.com/en-PK/blog/herb-datacenter-replication/), and
[DBEvents](https://www.uber.com/en-PK/blog/dbevents-ingestion-framework/),
empowered thousands of internal developers to focus on their applications while
we handled storage for them. This was great for the developers inside Uber, but
we wanted to think bigger. We wanted anyone to be able to benefit from this kind
of platform, even if you didn't work at Uber. After a lot of deliberation we
ended up with Tigris: Globally distributed object storage for everyone.

In April 2023, I met with [Kurt](https://twitter.com/mrkurt) and the Fly.io
team. Kurt's
"[two-hour problem](https://fly.io/blog/we-raised-a-bunch-of-money/)" philosophy
resonated with me. There isn't really any reason why it should take more than
two hours to make my app run in more data centers at the same time. It's hard.
Really hard. Entire venture-funded startups are designed around doing it and
developers know it. They don't even try because they've been conditioned to give
up and rightly so.

Fly.io makes it dead simple to run your application close to your users. They
solved “being real-time” within a two-hour window for developers by enabling
them to deploy their application on six continents using the same command they
use to deploy it to one data center.

At Tigris, we share the same vision: storing objects globally shouldn't take
more than two hours. It should be the default. Tigris takes care of the hard
parts for you. It allows an application to read and write data globally with
zero configuration. You can write objects in San Jose and then seamlessly fetch
them from Sydney, all while getting local-read performance. You can even write
conflicting updates in multiple regions simultaneously, and Tigris will resolve
the conflicts and give a consistent global view of the data. It is a truly
global active-active storage platform.

One of the main blockers for moving applications wholesale to a modern cloud
such as Fly.io is storage. Many applications are forced to keep their storage on
a traditional cloud like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage because nobody really
wants to mess with it once everything is configured to work. Tigris makes this
turnkey.

**That's why we're so excited to launch global object storage on Fly.io's
platform [across their 35+ locations](https://fly.io/docs/reference/regions/).**

_Today, Tigris is deployed in FRA, GRU, IAD, JNB, LHR, MAD, ORD, SIN, SJC, and
SYD. We're working on deploying across the rest of Fly.io's regions._

## How do I get started?

To use Tigris, you need a [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) account. If you don't have
one, you can get yourself one [here](https://fly.io/app/sign-up). Then it's as
simple as `fly storage create`:

```bash
$ fly storage create
? Choose a name, use the default, or leave blank to generate one: demo-bucket
Your  project (demo-bucket) is ready. See details and next steps with:

Setting the following secrets on ot-demo:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
BUCKET_NAME
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3
```

Fill in the bucket name and the configuration for AWS S3 SDK will be injected
into your application. All you need to do now is write objects into your bucket
and they're globally available. Instantly.

## A note on pricing

During the public beta starting today, we will not be charging for usage. We
want to take this time to iron out any additional issues and make Tigris as
polished as we can before we feel comfortable charging you for it. We will
update you with pricing information as it becomes available. Don't worry though,
everything will go into your Fly.io bill. We don't want to make your life harder
with your accounting department in the process of making your life easier with
cloud storage.

We hope you have fun building with Tigris and we would love to see what you
build. Reach out to us on
[X (formerly Twitter)](https://twitter.com/TigrisData), or on the
[Fly.io community](https://community.fly.io/tag/storage) forum and let us know
your feedback.
