Training modern AI models requires two key ingredients: a powerful framework
like **PyTorch** and a massive amount of data. But how do you efficiently feed
that data from cloud storage into your GPU for training? Storing datasets in a
scalable, affordable object storage service like **Tigris** is the first step,
but bridging the gap to your training script is where the magic happens. ✨

This guide will show you how to stream data directly from a Tigris bucket into
your PyTorch training loop, creating a seamless and high-performance data
pipeline.

## Getting Started: Setting Up Your Tigris Bucket

First things first, you need a place to store your data and a way for PyTorch to
access it. This involves two quick steps: creating a bucket and generating
access keys.

1.  **Create a New Bucket**: Head over to
    **[storage.new](https://storage.new)**. Give your bucket a descriptive name
    (e.g., `my-image-datasets`). For most training use cases, the **Standard**
    storage tier is the perfect choice.
2.  **Create an Access Keypair**: Now, go to
    **[storage.new/accesskey](https://storage.new/accesskey)**. Create a new
    keypair, giving it a memorable name. For security, grant it **Editor**
    permissions for only the specific bucket you just created.

Once you click "Create," copy the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**
somewhere safe, like a password manager. You won't see the secret key again\!

## Bridging the Gap: Connecting PyTorch to S3

To enable PyTorch to talk to an S3-compatible service like Tigris, we need a
special connector library. The
[s3torchconnector](https://github.com/awslabs/s3-connector-for-pytorch) package
is built exactly for this purpose.

Install it using pip or however you install dependencies:

```sh
pip install s3torchconnector
```

This package provides custom PyTorch `Dataset` classes that know how to stream
objects directly from an S3 bucket.

## Choosing Your Data Access Strategy

With the connector installed, you need to decide _how_ you want to access your
data. The library offers two main approaches, and choosing the right one is key
for performance.

Then import the necessary classes into your Python script:

```py
from s3torchconnector import S3IterableDataset, S3MapDataset, S3ClientConfig
```

Now, let's pick a dataset style:

- 🗺️ **Map-Style (`S3MapDataset`)**: This acts like a giant list or array. It
  first lists _all_ the objects in your bucket prefix, which lets you know the
  total size (`len()`) and access any object by its index (e.g.,
  `dataset[123]`). This is great for smaller, finite datasets where you need to
  shuffle the entire collection or access items randomly. **Warning**: The
  initial listing can be slow if you have millions of objects.
- ➡️ **Iterable-Style (`S3IterableDataset`)**: This acts like a stream. It
  fetches objects one by one as you iterate over it, without knowing the total
  count beforehand. This is **highly recommended for large-scale training**, as
  it has a low memory footprint and starts feeding data immediately. It's
  perfect for massive or even infinite datasets.

For most deep learning workflows, `S3IterableDataset` is the way to go. Let's
set one up to read from our Tigris bucket:

```py
# Define your Tigris bucket and prefix (folder)
bucket_name = "my-dataset-bucket"
prefix = "train/images"
dataset_uri = f"s3://{bucket_name}/{prefix}"

# Create an iterable dataset pointing to Tigris
dataset = S3IterableDataset.from_prefix(
    dataset_uri,
    region="auto",                      # Tigris is global, so "auto" works great
    endpoint="https://t3.storage.dev",  # The Tigris S3 endpoint
    enable_sharding=True                # Important for multi-worker data loading!
)
```

We've pointed the dataset to our bucket's URI and specified the Tigris
`endpoint`. We also set `enable_sharding=True`, which is crucial for ensuring
that when we use multiple data loading processes, each one gets a unique slice
of the data.

## From Raw Files to Training Tensors

The dataset now knows how to fetch files, but your model needs **tensors**, not
raw image files. We'll define a `transform` function to handle this conversion
on the fly. This function will take a file object from S3 and turn it into a
tensor (and a label) ready for training.

Let's assume our bucket contains images, and the label is encoded in the file
path (e.g., `train/images/7/img123.png`, where `7` is the class label).

```python
from PIL import Image
import io
import torchvision.transforms as T

# A standard image transformation pipeline
transform_pipeline = T.Compose([
    T.Resize((224, 224)),
    T.ToTensor(),
    T.Normalize(mean=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5], std=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5])
])

def obj_to_tensor(obj):
    # 1. Read the raw bytes of the S3 object
    byte_data = obj.read()

    # 2. Convert bytes to a PIL image
    image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(byte_data)).convert("RGB")

    # 3. Apply our transformation pipeline to get a tensor
    tensor = transform_pipeline(image)

    # 4. Extract the label from the object key (file path)
    # Example key: "train/images/7/img123.png"
    label_str = obj.key.split("/")[-2]  # This gets "7"
    label = int(label_str)

    return tensor, label
```

Now, we just need to tell our dataset to use this function. We can pass it
directly during creation:

```python
dataset = S3IterableDataset.from_prefix(
    dataset_uri,
    region="auto",
    endpoint="https://t3.storage.dev",
    transform=obj_to_tensor, # Apply our function to each object!
    enable_sharding=True
)
```

## Firing Up the Training Loop with `DataLoader`

With our dataset ready to stream and transform data, the final piece is the
PyTorch `DataLoader`. This powerful utility wraps our dataset and automatically
handles batching, shuffling (for map-style datasets), and parallel data loading
using multiple worker processes.

Here’s how to set up an efficient `DataLoader` for streaming:

```python
import torch

from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

loader = DataLoader(
    dataset,
    batch_size=32,
    num_workers=4,           # Use multiple processes to fetch data in parallel
    pin_memory=True,         # Speeds up CPU to GPU memory transfers
    persistent_workers=True  # Avoids restarting workers every epoch
)
```

**A quick breakdown of these settings:**

- `num_workers=4`: This is a game-changer. It spawns 4 separate processes that
  fetch and transform data from Tigris simultaneously, preventing your GPU from
  sitting idle waiting for data.
- `pin_memory=True`: Pre-allocates memory on the CPU in a way that makes copying
  it to the GPU much faster.
- `persistent_workers=True`: Keeps the worker processes alive between epochs,
  saving on setup overhead.

Now you can use this `loader` in a standard PyTorch training loop:

```python
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model = ... # Your neural network model
model.to(device)
optimizer = ...
criterion = ...

model.train()
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch_idx, (images, labels) in enumerate(loader):
        # Move data to the GPU (non_blocking is faster with pin_memory=True)
        images = images.to(device, non_blocking=True)
        labels = labels.to(device, non_blocking=True)

        # Forward pass, backpropagation, and optimization
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        if batch_idx % 50 == 0:
            print(f"Epoch {epoch} | Batch {batch_idx} | Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
```

And that's it! Your training loop is now seamlessly pulling data from Tigris,
processing it on the fly, and feeding it to your GPU in efficient batches.
You've built a robust, scalable data pipeline for your machine learning
projects. Happy training! 🚀
