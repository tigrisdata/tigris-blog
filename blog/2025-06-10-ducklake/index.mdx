There’s a new data lake on the market: [DuckLake](https://ducklake.select/).
It’s worth the hype because it gives you an open standard that not only enables
you to run queries on your data lakes from anywhere, it outright encourages you
to run your query, metadata, and storage layers separately in whatever platform
works best for you. We've been thinking about DuckDB as a solution for Small
Data, but now with the limitless storage capability of object storage, it can
support massive scale datasets. Big Data doesn't have to be complicated.

One of the key changes with DuckLake is moving the metadata layer out of object
storage and into a dedicated database. But why would an object storage company
like Tigris be excited about putting _less_ data in object storage?

{/* truncate */}

Iceberg and Delta Lake both store their metadata in files on object storage:
Delta Lake uses a transactional log file within the object storage itself,
whereas Iceberg uses an external catalog that can be stored in a DB or in object
storage. The trouble comes when you handle concurrent writes. Someone has to
“win” and object storage systems don’t let you lock files without coordination
via DynamoDB or another service. DuckLake lets you handle concurrent writes via
the concurrent write support of your database engine of choice, you get all of
the benefits of a normal database without having to have all your data in one
disk. You get all the advantages of a database by actually using a database
instead of
[poorly emulating one with a bunch of flat files](https://www.e6data.com/blog/iceberg-metadata-evolution-after-compaction#:~:text=,understanding%20the%20iceberg%20file%20layout)\!

But if you really want to take advantage of that flexibility and choice that
DuckLake offers, you need to unstick all the data in your lakehouse from
$BigCloud’s storage where every gigabyte of egress to a tool in another cloud
has a cost. The metadata layer being separate from the data also eliminates
another point where other solutions can get your provider to dig you in the cost
department. Storing all your actual data in Tigris also gives you global
performance and the ability for your data to be accessible and fast from
anywhere.

<PullQuote>
  DuckLake lets you horizontally scale your queries with a serverless
  architecture on any cloud, and Tigris makes it economical to do so because
  Tigris has no egress fees.
</PullQuote>

Let's say that I have an ETL pipeline processing customer data and storing it in
a data lake on a Big Cloud provider like GCS. I have a fleet of Agents all using
the customer data to answer questions during Support workflows. If I've deployed
my Agents on an Agentic platform, I won't be guaranteed to run my queries within
the same Big Cloud as my storage. I’d have to pay by the gigabyte if I had the
gall to run that query from anywhere but Google Cloud. I can’t magically
teleport my laptop to be inside Google Cloud’s network (yeah, they have a VPN
product, but you still have to pay egress for that) and my neocloud workloads
definitely aren’t in Google Cloud, so I’d have to restrict all of my planning to
find ways to lock myself deeper into the clutches of that ecosystem.

If we want to live in this bright multicloud future where we _can_ use the best
tool for the job, we need to make upfront choices about where and how we store
data. When you use DuckLake with its metadata in a Postgres database running
somewhere, you can connect to that data lake from any developer laptop, cloud
instance, or serverless worker. This allows you to take the concepts of
[Nomadic Compute](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/nomadic-compute/) to your
data, meaning that you can leverage the cost savings of neo-clouds to manage
your data from anywhere no matter how big or small it is. Your data will
automatically move around to where it’s used without having to worry about
egress fees and cost management.

## DuckLake is a data lakehouse for big and small data

DuckLake lets you import data from SQL databases and object storage, then stores
that aggregated data in object storage so that queries are nice and quick. This
lets you store and run queries on data that is bigger than your local device can
ever store, everything is queried on demand and you only operate on the data you
actually use. When you use this with Tigris, we have
[no egress fees](https://www.tigrisdata.com/pricing/), meaning that you don’t
have to worry about the bill when you make a big query.

DuckLake has two basic parts:

- Metadata in a SQL database (MySQL, Postgres, DuckDB, or SQLite)
- Data storage in object storage or on the local filesystem

Here’s how you declare a table in DuckLake:

```
INSTALL ducklake;
LOAD ducklake;

ATTACH
  'ducklake:postgres:dbname=postgres host=localhost'
AS cloud
  ( DATA_PATH 's3://xe-ducklake/data/'
  );

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cloud.customers
  ( id INTEGER NOT NULL
  , username VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL
  , email_address VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL
  , created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
  , updated_at TIMESTAMP
  , deleted_at TIMESTAMP
  , usage_kind VARCHAR
  );
```

That’s it. No setting up massive infrastructure, no bargaining with the powers
that be for API access, and no overhead and churn to maintain the setup
requiring expensive consultants to emit utterances that no human should have to
comprehend. You just declare the table and _you’re done_. There are no more
steps.

Don’t want to store the metadata in Postgres? You don’t need to:

```sql
INSTALL ducklake;
LOAD ducklake;

ATTACH
  'ducklake:metadata.ducklake'
AS cloud
  ( DATA_PATH './data'
  );
```

This is how I play with DuckLake on my MacBook. I’m only dealing with data
[much smaller than ram](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/anubis/), but the best
part about this in my book is that I can fit all of the moving parts in one part
of my mental context. This leaves me able to think about what I’m doing without
having to think too much about how I have to do it. If I need more space, I can
just farm it out to Tigris:

```sql
ATTACH
  'ducklake:metadata.ducklake'
AS cloud
  ( DATA_PATH 's3://xe-ducklake/hoshimi-miyabi-hacking/'
  );
```

But realistically, you probably want to store the DuckLake metadata in Postgres
so you can connect to the same data lake from another computer, production
instances, or serverless infrastructure. Once your lake is set up, you can
import the data from another Postgres database:

```sql
INSTALL postgres;
LOAD postgres;

ATTACH
  'dbname=dunda-prod user=readonly host=dunda-prod-pg.dunda.ti.do'
AS prod
  ( TYPE postgres
  , READ_ONLY
  );

INSERT INTO
  cloud.customers
    ( id
    , username
    , email_address
    , created_at
    , updated_at
    , deleted_at
    )
SELECT
  id
, username
, email_addresses
, created_at
, updated_at
, deleted_at
FROM
  cloud.users
WHERE
  deleted_at IS NOT NULL;
```

But what about your telemetry usage data in Tigris? You can import that too.
Let’s say your data roughly looks like this:

```json
{
  "created_at": "2025-06-09 20:38:40",
  "user_id": 1337,
  "action_verb": "CreateDocument",
  "metadata": {
    "document_id": "019755f9-7965-78ee-8677-b21ee8fa9bb6",
    "org_id": "019755f9-f6b0-763b-9882-b773cfaf828c"
  }
}
```

Then make your table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE cloud.telemetry
  ( created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
  , user_id INTEGER NOT NULL
  , action_verb VARCHAR NOT NULL
  , metadata MAP(STRING, STRING) NOT NULL
  );
```

And load it directly from the cloud to the cloud:

```sql
INSERT INTO
  cloud.telemetry
    ( created_at
    , user_id
    , action_verb
    , metadata
    )
SELECT
  *
FROM
  READ_JSON
    ( 's3://dunda-prod-telemetry/new/**/*.jsonl'
    , columns =
      { created_at: 'TIMESTAMP NOT NULL'
      , user_id: 'INTEGER NOT NULL'
      , action_verb: 'VARCHAR NOT NULL'
      , metadata: 'MAP(string, STRING) NOT NULL'
      }
    , format = 'nd'
    );
```

### Lakehouses in anger

As for how you’d use this in production, let’s think about one of the most
common issues when making a Software-as-a-Service business: users that sign up
and then never do anything with your product. Typically you’d want to send them
an email to let them know about some feature of the product that will entice
them to re-engage with your product. Typically when you’re trying to figure out
when to send these re-engagement emails, you will need to combine non-relational
telemetry observations (such as when your product emits events like
CreatedDocument or StartFunction) with relational data (such as user or
organization details from your database). Historically, figuring out when to
send these requires a lot of “database churn” with fields like the last time a
user logged into the platform, or putting all of those events into your database
in the first place. These make your SRE team unhappy, but they do _work_. We can
do better though\!

DuckLake lets you just run the query on your data lakehouse directly. Assume
that a perfectly spherical import script runs every so often to sync data from
Postgres and Tigris to your lakehouse. In order to mark customers to be selected
for a re-engagement email, you can write a single query:

```
-- If users have no telemetry activity but their account was created a week ago, set them to Reengage.
-- When the re-engagement is sent but there's no activity after a week, set them to GaveUp.
-- Otherwise, if the user has activity then set them to Active.

WITH last_event AS (
    SELECT
        c.id,
        c.created_at                         AS customer_created_at,
        COUNT(t.*)                           AS evt_cnt,              -- 0 = never seen
        MAX(t.created_at)                    AS last_evt_at,          -- NULL if no events
        arg_max(t.action_verb, t.created_at) AS last_evt_verb      -- DuckDB  v0.10+; picks verb of the latest row
    FROM cloud.customers AS c
    LEFT JOIN cloud.telemetry AS t
           ON t.user_id = c.id
    GROUP BY c.id, c.created_at
)
, desired AS (
    SELECT
        id,
        CASE
            WHEN evt_cnt = 0
                 AND customer_created_at < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '7 days'
            THEN 'Reengage'

            WHEN evt_cnt > 0
                 AND last_evt_verb = 'Reengaged'
                 AND last_evt_at   < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '7 days'
            THEN 'GaveUp'

            WHEN evt_cnt > 0
            THEN 'Active'

            ELSE usage_kind            -- leave as‑is for very new sign‑ups, etc.
        END AS new_usage_kind
    FROM last_event
)
UPDATE cloud.customers AS c
SET    usage_kind = d.new_usage_kind
FROM   desired AS d
WHERE  c.id = d.id
  AND  c.usage_kind IS DISTINCT FROM d.new_usage_kind;
```

This lets you seamlessly weave relational data from your databases with
non-relational data in object storage. All of that data we inserted gets stored
in Tigris so that you only have to do your big imports _once_. Throw this into a
serverless function, make it run every day as a cronjob, and then you can have
another worker find customers that need to re-engage and send them gentle
encouragement.

## How it works

DuckLake has two basic parts:

- Metadata in a SQL database (MySQL, Postgres, DuckDB, or SQLite)
- Data storage in object storage or on the local filesystem

When you create a DuckLake backed by Postgres, it creates a bunch of tables for
you:

```
thoth=> \dt
                       List of relations
 Schema |                 Name                  | Type  | Owner
--------+---------------------------------------+-------+-------
 public | ducklake_column                       | table | thoth
 public | ducklake_column_tag                   | table | thoth
 public | ducklake_data_file                    | table | thoth
 public | ducklake_delete_file                  | table | thoth
 public | ducklake_file_column_statistics       | table | thoth
 public | ducklake_file_partition_value         | table | thoth
 public | ducklake_files_scheduled_for_deletion | table | thoth
 public | ducklake_inlined_data_tables          | table | thoth
 public | ducklake_metadata                     | table | thoth
 public | ducklake_partition_column             | table | thoth
 public | ducklake_partition_info               | table | thoth
 public | ducklake_schema                       | table | thoth
 public | ducklake_snapshot                     | table | thoth
 public | ducklake_snapshot_changes             | table | thoth
 public | ducklake_table                        | table | thoth
 public | ducklake_table_column_stats           | table | thoth
 public | ducklake_table_stats                  | table | thoth
 public | ducklake_tag                          | table | thoth
 public | ducklake_view                         | table | thoth
```

All of these tables are used to create the mappings of what tables point to
which data. This data can be stored on your local laptop for quick hacking or in
object storage like Tigris for when your data gets much bigger than any one
computer can possibly store.

Additionally, any time you make a change to your DuckLake, it creates a snapshot
of the entire state of the world so that you can roll back changes when you mess
things up. This means that you can import data, run big analytics queries, and
more without any fear of losing data. All the data will be safely stored in
Tigris and you can do whatever queries you want from anywhere in the world
without having to pay egress fees.

Let’s say you need to look at data about a specific customer from a week ago:

```
SELECT
  *
FROM
  cloud.customers
WHERE
  email_address LIKE '%@conto.so'
AT ( TIMESTAMP => now() - INTERVAL '1 week' );
```

And bam, every one of your customers at Contoso has all their information show
up. Need to make sure that the re-engagement emails got sent out back then? You
can just do that without having to do a mass scan of object storage.

Honestly this is one of the coolest parts of DuckLake in my book. Sure it’s not
as theoretically performant as it would be if all the data was directly on my
laptop, but being able to operate on extremely large datasets more than makes up
for the downsides. Your postgres database won’t let you roll back a change that
someone messed up a week ago, for that you’d have to restore from backup.

## The cloud’s the limit

Of course, this isn’t just limited to your developer laptop. You can access your
DuckLake datasets from the
[Node.js](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/node_neo/overview) client too\!
Take a gander:

```javascript
import duckdb, { DuckDBConnection } from "@duckdb/node-api";

console.log("duckdb version", duckdb.version());

const connection = await DuckDBConnection.create();

for (const statement of [
  `INSTALL postgres`,
  `LOAD postgres`,
  `INSTALL ducklake`,
  `LOAD ducklake`,
  `INSTALL httpfs`,
  `LOAD httpfs`,
  `INSTALL json`,
  `LOAD json`,
  `CREATE OR REPLACE PERSISTENT SECRET tigris (
    TYPE s3,
    PROVIDER config,
    KEY_ID 'tid_access_key_id',
    SECRET 'tsec_secret_access_key',
    REGION 'auto',
    ENDPOINT 't3.storage.dev',
    URL_STYLE 'vhost',
    SCOPE 's3://xe-ducklake'
  )`,
  `CREATE OR REPLACE SECRET postgres_localhost (
    TYPE postgres,
    HOST 'localhost',
    PORT 5432,
    DATABASE postgres,
    USER 'root',
    PASSWORD 'hunter2'
  )`,
  `ATTACH 'ducklake:postgres:dbname=postgres host=localhost' as cloud (DATA_PATH 's3://xe-ducklake/data/')`,
]) {
  await connection.run(statement);
}
```

Now you can `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` to your heart’s content\!
Just make sure that the statements that create secrets are put safely into
environment variables. This is super useful for making sure that your import
jobs run in Lambda or for distributing analytics jobs across an entire fleet.

Imagine a world where you have an API that creates resources and you want to
charge users for those resources. You could imagine a world where that data gets
written to Tigris based on the time it’s written, such as:

```
s3://dunda-prod-usage/2025/06/10/13/*.jsonl
```

And then your lambda jobs could take the data from the last hour (remember: time
is “consistent enough” in values over one hour), massage it into DuckDB, and
then update it into your production database with what’s changed\! Remember, you
can attach Postgres databases the same way you can attach a DuckLake\! Throw in
some
[lifecycle rules](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/buckets/object-lifecycle-rules/)
to delete the raw usage data after 6 months and add some batching to your
uploading and you can get all of the fun of a fancy streaming analytics setup
with nearly none of the bloat of having to reinvent the entire world\!

## The new era of databases

Personally, I think that DuckLake is really cool and this post barely scratches
the surface of what you can do. It’s a SQL database without limits embedded
right into your app. No more having to resize database instances for the data
team. No more complicated import pipelines to get data from object storage into
a database engine. You just query your data and then you’re done with it. This
is seriously one of the most underrated data science superpowers and if you play
your cards right, you can scale fearlessly.

As I dig into DuckLake some more, I’m going to show you some demos that really
play into Tigris and DuckLake working together to make data analytics work great
on big and small scales. Join along for the ride\!
