import tigrisConfig from "@site/tigris.config.js";

This blog outlines the deployment of Tigris on an Google's Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Autopilot instance.

The installation will use recommended settings for redundancy, allocating more resources than a simple laptop based installation would. For more information on the laptop based installation please consult our [previous blog](https://blog.tigrisdata.com/deploy-tigris-on-your-laptop)!

If you would rather watch a video, check out the deployment in action on YouTube:

# Requirements

Below are the requirements for the installation box and the target Kubernetes environment.

The list of items required:

- Helm
- Google Cloud SDK
- git and tigris-deploy repository
- GKE cluster with sufficient quotas

## Installation Host

We will require Helm to perform the installation. It is assumed that the installation host already has access to the deployment target GKE cluster.

The version of `helm` used in this blog was:

```shell
❯ helm version
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.10.1", GitCommit:"9f88ccb6aee40b9a0535fcc7efea6055e1ef72c9", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.19.2"}
```

To interface with the GKE cluster using `kubectl` conveniently, you may want to install the GKE plugin. You can install it with this command:

```shell
❯ gcloud components install gke-gcloud-auth-plugin
```

## GKE

Fortunately, GKE Autopilot clusters automatically comes with a set of controllers installed. The list includes [GKE Ingress](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/ingress)
that enables the creation of external load balancers for Ingress resources and controllers that manage other aspects of GCP, such as persistent disks.

One of the challenges of ensuring a successful deployment in GCP is to manage quotas efficiently. You will want to ensure quotas allow for sufficient CPU and SSD storage allocation.

Using the defaults of the Helm Chart, the following quotas proved to be sufficient:

![GCP Quotas](./gcp_quota.png)

# Deployment

The installation deploys the following components:

- Kubernetes Operator for FoundationDB
- FoundationDB
- Tigris Search (TypeSense)
- Tigris Server

You can install the components individually or together, using the encompassing tigris-stack Helm Chart. Below I’m going to use this Chart to install Tigris.

## Prepare For Deployment

Next, check out the deploy script repository:

```shell
❯ git clone git@github.com:tigrisdata/tigris-deploy.git
Cloning into 'tigris-deploy'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 177, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (97/97), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (60/60), done.
remote: Total 177 (delta 43), reused 68 (delta 34), pack-reused 80
Receiving objects: 100% (177/177), 87.68 KiB | 568.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (63/63), done.
```

Navigate to the folder which contains the helm chart of tigris-stack:

```shell
❯ cd tigris-deploy/helm/tigris-stack
```

## Deploy Tigris Stack

To ensure there is initial quorum for Tigris Search, we should deploy it initially with a single replica.

```shell
❯ helm install tigris-stack . --set tigris-search.replicas=1

At this point your cluster will likely only have a few nodes:

```shell

Tigris will restart a few times before it changes state to `Running`. This is due to the unavailability of FoundationDB, the key-value store Tigris uses for persistence.

As you can see below, fdb is still in a Pending state when the `tigris-server` Pods are already up:

:info: You can improve the deployment sequence by using more sophisticated deployment methods, such as Synchronization Waves in ArgoCD!

Give Autopilot enough time to scale up nodes for the deployment. FoundationDB will likely trigger a separate scale-up event on its own.

Following the scale up of the nodes, the services to slowly also come up. As it is waiting for foundational services to start,

However, after about 15 minutes the Pods should become available:

That’s it, your Tigris deployment should be now on its way coming up!

## Validate Deployment

This time we are going to validate Tigris Server using the Tigris CLI, using a small linux Pod that was deployed in the same namespace as the Tigris Stack.

First we need to install the CLI:

```shell
$ curl -sSL https://tigris.dev/cli-linux | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin
...
$ ls -la /usr/local/bin/tigris
-rwxr-xr-x 1 1001 121 17264640 Nov  3 07:21 /usr/local/bin/tigris
```

Set TIGRIS_URL to point at the Service endpoint of `tigris-server`:

```shell
$ export TIGRIS_URL=http://tigris-http:80
```

After that see if you can interact with the Tigris database using the `tigris` utility:

```shell
$ tigris quota limits
{
  "ReadUnits": 100,
  "WriteUnits": 25,
  "StorageSize": 104857600
}

$ tigris server info
{
  "server_version": "v1.0.0-beta.17"
}

$ tigris server version
tigris server version at http://tigris-http:80 is v1.0.0-beta.17

$ tigris create database robert

$ tigris list databases
robert
```

# Preparing For Production

## Scaling Search Out

To ensure Search is also redundant, once the deployment has progressed past transient state, Tigris Search should be scaled up to multiple replicas. In order to maintain quorum, the number of replicas should be set to an odd number, at a minimum of 3.

Below command will increase the number of Tigris Search replicas to 5 which should be a sufficiently large number of replicas for an initial Production deployment:

```shell
❯ helm upgrade tigris-stack . --set tigris-search.replicas=5
W1103 18:12:06.790278   82440 gcp.go:119] WARNING: the gcp auth plugin is deprecated in v1.22+, unavailable in v1.26+; use gcloud instead.

You can verify that additional replicas were started, using `kubectl`:

```shell
❯ kubectl get pods | grep tigris

```

The replicas should catch up quickly as there isn't a lot of search index to be synchronized. However, GKE Autopilot might need to scale up the nodes prior:

```shell
❯ kubectl describe pod tigris-search-1 | tail
W1103 18:14:04.069915   83269 gcp.go:119] WARNING: the gcp auth plugin is deprecated in v1.22+, unavailable in v1.26+; use gcloud instead.

It should take only a minute or two to get them up `Running`:

```

## Ending TLS

For a Production installation you will want to add a certificate to your load balancer. However, as this step does not have any Tigris specific detail, we are going to skip detailing this step.

# Wrapping Up!

I hope above could illustrate how easy it is to deploy Tigris to GKE Autopilot! Feel free to compare it to the [article about deploying Tigris to EKS](https://blog.tigrisdata.com/deploying-tigris-on-eks)
where we discussed the steps necessary to deploy it to AWS!

If you have any suggestions for us on Tigris related subjects that you think people might find interesting, feel free to reach out to us on either our Tigris Community <a href={tigrisConfig.discordUrl}>Discord</a> server!

Hope you enjoyed reading or watching this blog or vlog! If you did, stay tuned as next we are going to cover a few interesting subjects such as performing logical backups and restores with Tigris!
