With PyTorch Conference 2025 kicking off in San Francisco next week (Oct 22-23),
we're gearing up to connect with PyTorch developers and dive deep into the
sessions pushing the boundaries of **AI infrastructure, storage, and
performance**.  
Here are the five talks we're most looking forward to, each one showcasing
performance optimizations for AI workloads.

### 1. Scaling KV Caches for LLMs: How LMCache + NIXL Handle Network and Storage Heterogeneity (NVIDIA, University of Chicago)

Large Language Models generate huge key–value caches, and this
[session](https://pytorchconference.sched.com/event/27QEg/scaling-kv-caches-for-llms-how-lmcache-+-nixl-handle-network-and-storage-heterogeneity-junchen-jiang-university-of-chicago-moein-khazraee-nvidia?iframe=yes&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no)
by **Junchen Jiang (University of Chicago)** and **Moein Khazraee (NVIDIA)**
explores how LMCache makes these caches reusable across memory tiers — from GPU
RAM to object storage — while NIXL accelerates transfers across heterogeneous
storage and network backends.

It’s a dive into **smart caching for AI workloads**, the kind of intelligent
data movement we think about daily at Tigris when building globally distributed
storage systems.

### 2. Enabling Lightweight, High-Performance FSDP With NVIDIA GPU (NVIDIA)

This
[talk](https://pytorchconference.sched.com/event/27QDK/enabling-lightweight-high-performance-fsdp-with-nvidia-gpu-jianbin-chang-cn-cory-ye-xuwen-chen-sangkug-lym-nvidia?iframe=no)
by **Xuwen Chen, Jianbin Chang, Sangkug Lym, and Cory Ye (all NVIDIA)** dives
into NVIDIA’s optimized implementation of Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP).  
By offloading collective communication to NVLink and InfiniBand SHARP and
reducing GPU memory fragmentation, they achieve remarkable training efficiency.

It’s a perfect showcase of **hardware-aware optimization**, where deep learning
frameworks evolve to squeeze every ounce of performance from modern compute
infrastructure.

### 3. Amazingly Fast and Incredibly Scalable Inference With NVIDIA’s Dynamo and TensorRT-LLM (NVIDIA)

In this
[session](https://pytorchconference.sched.com/event/28d9k/sponsored-session-amazingly-fast-and-incredibly-scalable-inference-with-nvidias-dynamo-and-tensorrt-llm-harry-kim-laikh-tewari-nvidia?iframe=no),
**Harry Kim** and **Laikh Tiwari (NVIDIA)** pair **NVIDIA Dynamo’s disaggregated
inference architecture** with **TensorRT-LLM’s optimized execution engine**. It
shows lightning-fast model serving through intelligent workload splitting and
GPU kernel optimization.

It’s the kind of performance-first engineering that mirrors how we enable
high-throughput data pipelines at Tigris — precise, efficient, and scalable.

### 4. Efficient MoE Pre-training at Scale on AMD GPUs With TorchTitan (AMD, Meta)

This
[talk](https://pytorchconference.sched.com/event/27QCY/efficient-moe-pre-training-at-scale-on-amd-gpus-with-torchtitan-liz-li-yanyuan-qin-amd-matthias-reso-meta?iframe=no)
by **Liz Li (AMD)**, **Yanyuan Qin (AMD)**, and **Less Wright (Meta)** showcases
how TorchTitan scales massive Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on AMD MI300X
GPUs.

With 4D parallelism, FP8 precision, and PyTorch-native distributed training, it
highlights how PyTorch is becoming **more open, flexible, and
hardware-agnostic** — an exciting direction for AI infrastructure engineers
building across diverse compute environments.

### 5. No GPU Left Behind: Scaling Online LLM Training With Co-located vLLM in TRL (IBM Research)

In this
[session](https://pytorchconference.sched.com/event/27QDQ/no-gpu-left-behind-scaling-online-llm-training-with-co-located-vllm-in-trl-mert-toslali-yu-chin-fabian-lim-ibm-research?iframe=no),
**Mert Toslali** and **Yu Chin Fabian Lim (IBM Research)** tackle inefficiencies
in LLM training loops by co-locating inference and training on the same GPUs.
This clever design removes network latency, eliminates idle GPUs, and improves
throughput by 1.7×.

It’s a brilliant example of **smart system placement** — moving computation to
where data already lives — a principle we embrace when building
performance-critical distributed infrastructure.

## Why These Talks Stand Out for Infrastructure Engineers

All five sessions share a common thread: they treat **performance as a
first-class goal**. Each talk digs into eliminating bottlenecks, improving
caching, or optimizing hardware utilization. From LMCache’s multi-tier cache
strategy to vLLM’s co-located inference, these sessions prove that efficiency
often comes not from bigger machines but from smarter design. Data locality,
reuse, and reduced latency are recurring themes, echoing what we see daily in
distributed storage and database systems. The best latency, after all, is no
latency — when data is already where it needs to be.

From NVIDIA’s NVLink and InfiniBand offloads to AMD’s MI300X-based MoE training,
PyTorch developers are using hardware-aware optimizations to redefine what scale
looks like. Together, they reveal how infrastructure innovation — caching
layers, optimized pipelines, distributed coordination — is shaping the next
generation of generative AI. The PyTorch community continues to blur the lines
between ML research and infrastructure craftsmanship, and these sessions show
that innovation often happens where storage, compute, and architecture meet.

At Tigris, we build the storage layer for developers who care about performance,
reliability, and simplicity. We're looking forward to incorporating what we
learn into our storage layer.

See you in San Francisco!
