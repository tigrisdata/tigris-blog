We're excited to announce the launch of
[Tigris Data](https://www.tigrisdata.com/), a company on the mission of
simplifying storage for developers.

Over the years, data has become increasingly complex and difficult to manage.
Developers have had their lives made exponentially more difficult due in large
part to all the different technologies they're expected to put together to build
modern applications.

The data sprawl also puts a lot of pressure on operations teams, who must
manage, maintain and secure different system. Then there is the onerous task of
operationalizing these system across multiple different cloud platforms.

<!--truncate-->

We have personally experienced the pain and financial cost from the complexity.
We want to make it easier for you to work with data by providing you with a
storage platform that helps quickly and easily store the data while providing
you with consistent high performance.

We're grateful to have assembled an amazing team that is passionate about
simplifying data management for developers. Our team has a wealth of experience
in storage systems, distributed systems, and databases. We're excited to bring
our knowledge and experience to bear on the problem of data management.

## The founders

Before starting Tigris Data, the founders,
[Ovais](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ovaistariq/),
[Himank](https://www.linkedin.com/in/himank-chaudhary-1937b958/), and
[Yevgeniy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/efirsov/), spent almost six years working
closely together at Uber. They developed and operated Uber's storage
infrastructure, leading projects like
[Docstore](https://eng.uber.com/schemaless-sql-database/),
[Herb](https://eng.uber.com/herb-datacenter-replication/), and
[DBEvents](https://eng.uber.com/dbevents-ingestion-framework/).

Their experiences have given them a lot of important lessons. They've learned
about the importance of making architectural choices that can scale,
establishing efficiency as a core principle, hiring the right talent, and
cultivating a culture that supports diversity, innovation, and growth.
