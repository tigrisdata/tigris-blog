We're excited to announce the launch of
[Tigris Data](https://www.tigrisdata.com/), a company on the mission of
simplifying data management for developers.

Over the years, data has become increasingly complex and difficult to manage.
Developers have had their lives made exponentially more difficult due in
large part to all these different technologies, data models, APIs, and
databases they're expected to put together to build modern applications.

The database sprawl also puts a lot of pressure on operations teams, who
must manage, maintain and secure these different databases and technologies.
Then there is the onerous task of operationalizing these databases across
multiple different cloud platforms.

<!--truncate-->

We have personally experienced the pain and financial cost from the complexity.
We want to make it easier for you to work with data by providing you with a
unified database that helps quickly and easily structure the data in any way
the application requires while providing you with one consistent experience
across a broad set of workloads.

Furthermore, we are building the database to be open source, so you can
avoid vendor lock-in and have the transparency to be sure that the product
will continue to evolve and improve over time. Additionally, it enables
anyone to be able to contribute improvements and extensions to the codebase.
All-in-all being open source makes the product more accessible, robust, and
secure for everyone.

We're grateful to have assembled an amazing team that is passionate about
simplifying data management for developers. Our team has a wealth of
experience in data management, distributed systems, and databases. We're
excited to bring our knowledge and experience to bear on the problem of data
management.

We're also proud to announce that in December of last year, we successfully
raised a seed round led by Basis Set with additional funding from General
Catalyst and many individual angels including founders at technology unicorns.

Now we're well on our way to a preview of the Tigris database later this year!

## The founders

Before starting Tigris Data, the founders,
[Ovais](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ovaistariq/),
[Himank](https://www.linkedin.com/in/himank-chaudhary-1937b958/), and
[Yevgeniy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/efirsov/), spent almost six years
working closely together at Uber. They developed and operated Uber's storage
infrastructure, leading projects like
[Docstore](https://eng.uber.com/schemaless-sql-database/),
[Herb](https://eng.uber.com/herb-datacenter-replication/), and
[DBEvents](https://eng.uber.com/dbevents-ingestion-framework/).

Their experiences have given them a lot of important lessons. They've
learned about the importance of making architectural choices that can scale,
establishing efficiency as a core principle, hiring the right talent, and
cultivating a culture that supports diversity, innovation, and growth.
