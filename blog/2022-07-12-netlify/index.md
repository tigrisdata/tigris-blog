As the world increasingly shifts to digital-first interactions, the need for
fast, reliable, and secure web applications has never been greater. The
Jamstack movement is a response to this need, focused on building web
applications that provide rich experiences while at the same time being easy
to deploy and scale. Data is, of course, crucial to building rich
experiences, and the support from Netlify will accelerate our mission to
provide the fast, reliable and secure data layer that Jamstack applications
need to thrive.
