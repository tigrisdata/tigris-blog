  <em>The evolution of AI tools</em>

As someone who's spent the better part of my career deep in distributed
systems - debugging memory issues at 3 a.m., obsessing over database consistency
models, and chasing every last bit of performance– I never thought I'd see the
day when writing code would feel conversational.

I don't write production code daily anymore. My role as a CEO is different now:
strategy, team-building, and product vision consume most of my day. But the
developer in me watches this transformation with awe. We're not just improving
developer tools. We're redefining how software is built.

Let's trace a path through the AI tools I've used through my career, and how
we're collaborating with AI at Tigris.

## From Autocomplete to AI Partners

Back in the late '90s,
**[IntelliSense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_completion#Visual_Studio)**
was revolutionary. Introduced by Microsoft in 1996, it cut down on repetitive
keystrokes and made exploring APIs easier. It wasn't "intelligent" in the way we
talk about intelligence today, but it did reduce documentation lookups
significantly.

Fast-forward 30 years, and we're no longer just talking about keystroke savings.
We're talking about AI partners, tools that understand intent, design systems,
and even debug complex workflows. The jump from IntelliSense to GitHub Copilot,
to Cursor, and now to Claude Code, isn't incremental. It's exponential.

## The Four Generations of Developer Assistance

If I map out my own experience with these tools, I see four clear generations:

<Timeline
  items={[
    {
      period: "1996–2021",
      title: "IntelliSense Era",
      features: [
        "Pattern matching & static analysis",
        "Single-file context awareness",
        "20-30% keystroke reduction",
      ],
    },
    {
      period: "2021–2024",
      title: "AI Revolution (Copilot)",
      features: [
        "Large language models (Codex/GPT)",
        "Multi-file context",
        "[35-55% faster development](https://github.blog/2023-03-23-github-copilot-x-the-ai-powered-developer-experience/)",
      ],
    },
    {
      period: "2024–2025",
      title: "AI-Native IDEs (Cursor)",
      features: [
        "Project-wide understanding",
        "Multi-model flexibility",
        "Lower latency than Copilot",
      ],
    },
    {
      period: "2025–Present",
      title: "Prompt-Based Development (Claude Code or GPT-5 via Codex CLI)",
      features: [
        "Autonomous task execution",
        "Natural language programming",
        "Complete workflow automation",
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>

What strikes me most is not the raw capability improvements, but the shift in
how developers think about code. We've gone from **"type less"** to **"describe
what you want."**

## The Turning Point: GitHub Copilot

Copilot was my first real taste of AI, writing code that felt like my own. I
still remember asking it to generate a Terraform module for Tigris, our
S3-compatible object storage, and watching it produce over
**[2,000 lines of code](https://github.com/tigrisdata/terraform-provider-tigris)**
in minutes.

    display: "block",
    margin: "2rem auto",
  }}
/>

<div

    marginTop: "0.5rem",

  }}

  </em>
</div>

<div style={{ margin: "2rem" }} />

Was it perfect? Of course not. I had to review and make
**[1,000+ lines of enhancements](https://github.com/tigrisdata/terraform-provider-tigris/commit/0e49b0a450def187f592f7909851ff44fc4a96ec)**
before shipping. But that didn't matter. It turned a multi-day task into
something I could iterate on in an afternoon.

Copilot made me realize something fundamental: developers are now curators and
reviewers as much as they are authors of code.

## Cursor: The IDE Redefined

If Copilot felt like autocomplete on steroids, Cursor feels like hiring a junior
engineer who can read and understand the entire repository in seconds.

I recently used Cursor while working on our object storage cache for PyTorch and
Dask. I'd describe a design or a feature, **"optimal file reading that uses the
cached file handler"**, and Cursor would produce a usable draft across multiple
files.

It wasn't about typing anymore. It was about guiding. I found myself shifting
from "what code do I write?" to "how do I architect this system, so AI can fill
in the details?"

## Claude Code: The Prompt Revolution

By the time I had gotten comfortable with tools like Copilot and Cursor, I
thought I had a pretty good sense of what "AI-assisted development" could do.
Then I tried Claude Code.

Claude Code takes it one step further. It's not just embedded in an IDE; it's
like an autonomous copilot. Combined with **[Conductor](https://conductor.ai)**,
I can run multiple Claude agents in parallel. I first used Claude on
**[tigrisfs](https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigrisfs)**, our FUSE-based
filesystem that mounts S3-compatible object storage as a local POSIX drive. This
is deep infrastructure code, definitely not low-hanging fruit.

With a single command:

```bash
$ claude "Replace deprecated semaphore implementation"
```

Claude scans the **[tigrisfs](https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigrisfs)** repo,
finds the outdated code, implements a fix, tests it, and opens a
**[pull request](https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigrisfs/pull/33)** with a
detailed explanation.

<div style={{ margin: "2rem" }} />

The wild part? That PR is then reviewed by another AI agent: Copilot. Claude
takes the feedback, updates the code, and resubmits.

This wasn't just code generation. It was multi-step task execution, contextual
understanding, and collaborative iteration - all initiated from a single prompt.

This is where things clicked for me: we're no longer just writing code with AI's
help. We're supervising autonomous agents as they do the heavy lifting.

## The Future: From Coding to Conversing

We're entering a new phase of Conversational Development. Code is still
involved, but the interaction layer is now natural language. Here's where I
think we're heading:

- 50%+ of new code written by AI
- IDE → AI orchestration platform
- Developers focus on architecture, validation, and system thinking
- Prompt engineering becomes a core competency

We're not just witnessing a new generation of developer tools. We're witnessing
a redefinition of what it means to be a software engineer.

As a founder, this excites me. I see the potential to build faster, iterate more
intelligently, and remove the friction that slows innovation. But it also
demands a mindset shift.

Those who don't embrace this transformation will likely get left behind. At
Tigris, we're building the storage layer designed for the future of AI.
