We’ve added support for the [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) standard across our
website! This lets you have your agents do lookups into the Tigris documentation
and get better answers in a snap!

To get started, add a section like this to your [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/)
or [CLAUDE.md](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)
file:

```text
## Helpful Documentation

When asked about various services or tools, use these resources to help you:

- **AutoMQ**: https://www.automq.com/llms.txt
- **Pixeltable**: https://docs.pixeltable.com/llms.txt
- **Tigris** or **Tigris Data**: https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/llms.txt
  or https://www.tigrisdata.com/llms.txt
```

## What is llms.txt?

The new [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) standard is intended to give AI agents
a cheat sheet for interacting with a given product or service. This is a simple
text file that describes what something is and gives links to helpful
documentation so that your AI agents can get things done without causing an
undue burden on server resources. Here’s an example of what’s in there based on
the contents of the Tigris Docs’ llms.txt:

> Tigris is a globally distributed, S3-compatible object storage service that
> supports key-value access patterns, fulfills most of the AWS S3 API, enables
> AI workloads without egress fees, and is not a database or a CDN.

It also includes links to documentation so that agents can intelligently pick
the best answers from the docs and get you coding fearlessly. Here’s an example
of this in action where I ask Claude Code to write me some TypeScript using
[the Tigris Storage SDK](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdks/tigris/) to fork a
bucket:

  I'll help you find the documentation for forking a Tigris bucket in TypeScript. Let me fetch the Tigris documentation.

  Let me fetch the specific documentation about snapshots and forks for Tigris
  to get you the accurate TypeScript implementation details.
</Reasoning>

<ToolCall
  title={
    <>
      Called tool <code>web_fetch</code>
    </>
  }
  parameters={{
    url: "https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdks/tigris/snapshots-and-forks",
    format: "markdown",
  }}
  result={{
    title: "Snapshots and Forks | Tigris Object Storage Documentation",
    content:
      "Snapshots and forks extend traditional object versioning beyond individual [...]",
  }}
/>

To fork a Tigris bucket in TypeScript, use the @tigrisdata/storage SDK with the
createBucket function and pass the sourceBucketName option:

```typescript
import { createBucket } from "@tigrisdata/storage";

// Fork from current state of bucket
const fork = await createBucket(
  "llm-fork", // name of the new fork bucket
  {
    sourceBucketName: "llm-base", // parent bucket to fork from
  }
);

if (fork.error) {
  console.error("error creating fork", fork.error);
} else {
  console.log("bucket fork created");
}
```

To fork from a specific snapshot version:

```typescript
import { createBucket } from "@tigrisdata/storage";

const fork = await createBucket("llm-fork", {
  sourceBucketName: "llm-base",
  sourceBucketSnapshot: "1760550614083112540", // specific snapshot version
});

if (fork.error) {
  console.error("error creating fork", fork.error);
} else {
  console.log("bucket fork created");
}
```

Note: The source bucket must have snapshots enabled (`enableSnapshot: true`)
when it's created. Existing buckets cannot have snapshots enabled.

The documentation I fetched covers the complete API for forking Tigris buckets
in TypeScript. Is there anything specific you'd like to know more about, such
as:

- Listing snapshots before forking from a specific one
- Working with objects in the forked bucket
- Managing the fork lifecycle

Or would you like help implementing this in a particular context?

## Assemble your agentic infinity gauntlet today!

Try this out and see how you like it! You should also add the `llms.txt` files
for other services you use to your [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) file so that
your agents have all the context they need to succeed. Everything combined lets
you build apps in a snap!
