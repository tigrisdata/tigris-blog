## Tigris Raises $25M to Build the Storage Layer for the AI Era

_Led by Spark Capital, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz and others_

Today I'm thrilled to share that Tigris has raised our $25M Series A, led by
Spark Capital, with continued support from Andreessen Horowitz.

Tigris is a globally distributed storage service, purpose-built for AI. We make
it simple for developers to store and process training data at scale, serve
models with low latency anywhere in the world, and move freely across clouds
without paying the "cloud tax" of egress fees.

For AI teams, storage isn't just where the data sits; it's the foundation every
workload runs on. Yet the big clouds still treat storage as a sidecar to their
bundle of services. The result: vendor lock-in, hidden costs, and performance
bottlenecks that slow builders down. That model worked for the last generation
of workloads, but in AI it limits innovation.

  In the age of AI, lock-in isn't just costly, it slows you down. Innovation
  today is about performance, speed of iteration, and shipping faster than ever.
  If your data is trapped, your ability to innovate is trapped with it.
</BreakoutQuote>

With Tigris, AI teams get storage built for their workflows:

- Training at limitless scale
- Inference without borders
- Agents that collaborate safely
- Freedom to chase compute
- Faster iteration

This new round of funding gives us the resources to go further - including
deploying our own hardware in datacenters worldwide. **Unlike most startups that
build on Big Cloud, Tigris is operating on its own infrastructure.**

Owning the metal gives us full control over cost and performance, and lets us
differentiate from Big Cloud. Running on our own metal means we can pass savings
back to customers and scale without compromise.

## Traction

Some of the most prominent multimodal and media-generation AI platforms are
already built on Tigris:

- fal ([fal.ai](http://fal.ai)) - powering the fastest generative AI inference
  globally, fresh off a major fundraise.
- KREA ([krea.ai](http://krea.ai)) - a creative AI platform redefining digital
  media.
- hedra ([hedra.com](https://www.hedra.com/)) - a multimodal AI platform
  enabling creators and enterprises to build with AI.

Tigris also powers the new wave of developer-first cloud providers:

- Fly.io ([fly.io](http://fly.io)) - the public cloud for developers.
- Beam ([beam.cloud](https://www.beam.cloud/)) - infrastructure for building and
  scaling generative AI apps.

From cutting-edge AI startups to next-gen cloud platforms, the fastest-growing
companies are choosing Tigris as their storage foundation.

  Tigris is becoming the storage layer of choice for the builders shaping the
  future of AI.

  Tigris is building the new storage foundation for every AI company. This is
  the same team that built and scaled Uber's global storage platform, which is
  exactly the operational rigor you need to run a foundational infrastructure
  platform. We couldn't be more excited to partner with them.

  The next era of infrastructure will be defined by best-of-breed providers that
  push beyond the limits of today's cloud platforms. Just as AWS redefined how
  we build applications, the rise of AI is redefining how we think about
  storage, compute, and networking. Tigris embodies this shift: a team with deep
  storage pedigree reimagining what the storage layer must look like for the
  future of the cloud.

## Why Us

My co-founders and I built Uber's global storage platform, scaling systems like
[Docstore](https://www.uber.com/blog/schemaless-sql-database/),
[Herb](https://www.uber.com/blog/herb-datacenter-replication/), and
[DBEvents](https://www.uber.com/blog/dbevents-ingestion-framework/) to hundreds
of billions of requests daily. We know what it takes to run storage at global
scale, and we're bringing that same discipline and ambition to AI.

  We want to give builders their freedom back. In the age of AI, the best
  product should win, not the one tied to a single bundled stack.
</BreakoutQuote>

## Looking Ahead

Cloud is ripe for disruption. In AI, we're already seeing developers choose new
compute providers like CoreWeave and Together AI over the big clouds, because
they want best-of-breed, not bundles. The same shift is coming to storage.

Taking on Big Cloud requires more than APIs on rented servers. It means owning
the stack - from hardware to software - so we can innovate without compromise
and give builders an alternative that's faster, fairer, and free from lock-in.

The future of cloud should be a level playing field, where specialized providers
compete on quality and innovation, not on who can lock in the most data. Tigris
is that best-of-breed storage layer, and we're just getting started.
