# Tigris Update - March 2023

Hello, and welcome to the first Tigris update. Each month we'll share product and community highlights and let you know what to look out for in the coming month.

## What is Tigris?

Since this is our first update, I thought I'd start from the beginning and remind you what Tigris is.

Tigris is a serverless NoSQL Database and Search platform that offers a modern open source alternative to MongoDB and DynamoDB. Tigris allows developers to rapidly build applications with a platform that combines NoSQL database, full-text search, and sync mechanism. Tigris simplifies operations by automatically scaling throughput and storage as application traffic grows at a fraction of the cost of MongoDB and DynamoDB, while providing high availability and data security.

We manage a hosted version of Tigris that we call Tigris Cloud.

## Tigris MongoDB compatibility in beta

In March, we released Tigris MongoDB compatibility in beta, providing support for MongoDB 6.0+ CRUD and Aggregation operations. This means that any application that uses the supported MongoDB CRUD and Aggregation operations, no matter the programming language, can now use Tigris instead of a self-hosted MongoDB instance or MongoDB Atlas.

- [Read the announcement](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/mongodb-compatibility-beta/)
- Get started with the Tigris MongoDB compatibility quickstarts for:
  - [TypeScript & Node.js](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/quickstarts/mongodb-compatibility/typescript/)
  - [Go](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/quickstarts/mongodb-compatibility/go/)
  - [Java](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/quickstarts/mongodb-compatibility/java/)
  - [Python](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/quickstarts/mongodb-compatibility/python/)
  - [PHP](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/quickstarts/mongodb-compatibility/php/)
- Or try out Tigris MongoDB compatibility using [mongosh, the MongoDB REPL](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdkstools/mongodb-compatibility/mongosh/)

## NoSQL data modeling best practices

[![NoSQL Data Modeling Best Practices series](./nosql-data-modeling-best-practices.png)](/blog/tags/data-modeling/)

Our database engineer, Garren, published parts 1 and 2 of his NoSQL data modeling best practice guides.

In the first part, Garren covers [one-to-one relationships](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/modelling-one-to-one-relations/), and in the second, [one-to-many relationships](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/modeling-one-to-many-relations/).

Lookout for part 3, many-to-many relations, in April.

## Blog highlights

- [Tigris transaction internals and comparison with MongoDB transactions](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/transaction-internals-tigris/) - our CTO and co-founder walks through the technical details of how transactions are implemented in Tigris and how Tigris offers a simpler and cleaner transaction experience to the developers as compared to MongoDB.
- [Backing up FoundationDB](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/backing-up-foundationdb/) - how to backup and restore FoundationDB to S3 by our founding engineer, Peter.

## New Search releases coming in April

Over the past few weeks, we've been working on improving our [search functionality](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/concepts/searching/), and we'll be releasing this new functionality in April:

### Collection Search

The way Collection Search works in Tigris is changing. We presently automatically synchronize all collections and fields over to Search. This behavior changes in the upcoming release, and you will instead have to opt your collections fields into being available via search.

The changes required to your code are small. For example, in TypeScript you need to add a new `SearchField()` decorator to your data model definitions. So, existing code that looks as follows:

```ts
@TigrisCollection("posts")
class Post {
  @PrimaryKey(TigrisDataTypes.UUID, { order: 1, autoGenerate: true })
  id?: string;

  @Field()
  title: string;

  @Field()
  body: number;
}
```

Will have to be updated to use the new decorator with `PrimaryKey` fields always synchronized:

```ts
@TigrisCollection("posts")
class Post {
  @PrimaryKey(TigrisDataTypes.UUID, { order: 1, autoGenerate: true })
  id?: string;

  **@SearchField()**
  @Field()
  title: string;

  **@SearchField()**
  @Field()
  body: number;
}

```

### Standalone search

If you're not quite ready to move all your data into Tigris Database but want to benefit from Tigris Search, you will be able to use Tigris Search standalone.

Standalone search allows you to create indexes, insert, search, and delete documents in the index. You can take a look at the [TypeScript docs for Search](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdkstools/typescript/search/) now.

## Feedback request

We're a few months into our beta and excited by the feedback we've had so far. But we know that we will only be successful by making you successful - this means building a product that you're as excited about as we are.

So, we'd love to hear your feedback. Please get in touch via one of the following options:

- [Book a 30-minute chat with us](#calendly-linky)
- [Join the Tigris Discord](https://www.tigrisdata.com/discord/)
