# Maximizing the performance of e-commerce applications

E-commerce platforms have exploded in popularity over the last two decades.
A market that was already meant to reach a staggering $4.9 trillion by 2021
reached a record $13 trillion. From retail, accounting, trade, and
advertisements to bookings and banking, e-commerce platforms cover almost all
sectors relevant to our day-to-day activities. These platforms are accessible
through websites, as well as through mobile devices in the form of applications.

The term _e-commerce application_ can be a little confusing; it can more
generally describe the use of e-commerce in different sectors. It can also
represent the software applications used daily for online purchases and
service bookings. This article is about the second definition: it focuses on
e-commerce software applications and their different properties.

E-commerce applications allow you to check a product from multiple providers,
giving you access to diverse offers to choose the one that best suits your
budget. You can order food, goods, groceries, medication, and more with the
help of these applications. In addition, e-commerce apps don't just facilitate
you as a buyer but also allow you to sell products and services more
efficiently.

## Crucial factors that make an e-commerce application successful

The success of an e-commerce app depends on more than the bargains or products
on offer. An app's conversion rate—the process of converting visitors to
customers—relies on the following crucial factors:

- **Latency:** Speed of delivering the content to the users
- **Search experience:** Ability to get to their intended results fast

Latency is one of the main performance-related factors that will make your
e-commerce app stand out. One study recommends that your pages load within a
[three-second timeframe](https://www.slideshare.net/Radware/2015-spring-state-of-the-union-ecommerce-page-speed-web-performance-infographic),
or you risk losing your potential customer. This gives you an idea of how
latency plays a vital role in having a well-performing e-commerce app.

Another vital element of a successful e-commerce app is an effective search
experience. Search is often the first interaction customers have with any
e-commerce app, so it is crucial that they can find what they are looking for
easily.

With the above in mind, in this article, you'll learn how to maximize the
performance of your e-commerce apps.

## How to Maximize the Performance of Your E-commerce App

Now that you've learned the crucial factors to maximizing the performance of
an e-commerce app, let's jump straight to the steps you can take.

Out of all the reasons we are about to list, having the ability to support
complex data modeling effectively goes a long way in enhancing your app's
performance.

E-commerce apps are responsible for storing information about a wide variety
of products. These products tend to have different attributes and properties
across various categories. The attributes for products, for example, in the
"electronics" category will be very different from those for products in the
"food" category. Not all products may have similar attributes, even within the
"food" category. This leads to a need for rich data modeling capabilities that
don't fit well with traditional relational databases such as MySQL and
PostgreSQL.

Hence, the first step is to choose a database platform that can efficiently
store rich data structures and provide low latency data ingestion and retrieval.

Now turning over to search, a few things go into making a good search
experience, including relevance, speed, and accuracy. Relevance is essential
because customers need to find the products they're looking for. Speed is
vital because customers don't want to spend time waiting for results. Finally,
accuracy is essential because customers need to be confident that the results
are relevant to their needs. While these are important characteristics that
need to be considered when choosing the search platform for your e-commerce
app. It is also essential to consider how the data is made available to the
search platform to be indexed. Is it available in real-time, and is it
consistent? The answers to the two questions will dictate the relevance and
accuracy of the search results and, in the end, the experience for the users.

The best solution here is for the database platform we chose earlier to be
responsible for indexing the data consistently and making it available for
search in real time.

## How Tigris can help maximize the performance of your e-commerce app

You have now seen the crucial factors that affect the performance of e-commerce
apps. Let's look at how [Tigris](https://www.tigrisdata.com/) enables you to
maximize the performance of your app while at the same time reducing the
backend complexity.

Being a transactional document database, Tigris provides rich modeling
capabilities that can handle complex e-commerce application needs. It has an
integrated search engine that automatically enables real-time search across the
data stores. Its features make it an ideal database platform for e-commerce
applications. With Tigris, developers can focus on their application's business
logic while Tigris handles the backend data-related functionalities.

Let's look more closely at Tigris's capabilities in the context of e-commerce
apps, including a flexible document database, transactions, and real-time
search.

### A Flexible Document Database

Tigris provides an easy-to-use document database. You can format the data
according to your application's requirements thanks to the adaptable document
model, and you can still quickly change the data model when needed.

Here are the key concepts that can help you quickly get started:

- **Database:** A group of collections
- **Collection:** An ordered set of structured records called documents
- **Schema:** A user-defined structure for documents specified using JSON schema
- **Document:** A JSON object with a predefined schema
- **Primary key:** A key that uniquely identifies each document

Tigris enforces a schema on the data while allowing the schema to be modified
in a lightweight manner without requiring an expensive schema migration process
seen in traditional databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. This ensures that
the data evolves from one structure to another in a consistent manner while
still providing applications with the agility that they need. With this
flexible database, it is easy to support the rich data modeling needs of an
e-commerce application.

### Transactions

In any e-commerce application, it is essential to maintain data integrity.
This means that data should be accurate, consistent, and complete. Database
transactions help to ensure data integrity by providing a way to track changes.
For example, imagine a customer trying to purchase an item. The app will need
to track the items in the customer's shopping cart and the store's inventory.
If the process is not handled correctly, the customer's shopping cart can
become out of sync with the store's inventory. However, by using transactions,
the app can ensure that all data remains consistent.

Traditionally, document databases have been lax regarding the transactional
guarantees they provide. They either do not provide a sufficient level of
consistency, i.e., strict serializability, or they provide it in a way
unsuitable for high volume usage due to performance issues.

Thanks to its usage of FoundationDB as the underlying storage engine,
Tigris provides strictly serializable transactions, globally ordered, and
ACID-compliant transactions. Transactions can be performed across multiple
databases and collections. There are no limitations on how transactions can be
used with collections and documents. There are also no complex read or write
considerations to configure and no cross-shard restrictions, in contrast with
other document databases like MongoDB.

Hence, Tigris provides you with the right level of transactional consistency
that you need in your e-commerce application to help prevent errors and
provides the customer with a positive experience.

### Search Functionality

Tigris allows you to perform real-time search across all the data automatically.
This includes full-text search, faceted search, the ability to query nested
fields, field projections, and filtering based on conditions. With powerful
search functionality built-in, Tigris eliminates the need to run a separate
search platform and synchronize data.

A good search experience depends on providing consistent and relevant results,
which are crucial to user experience. Tigris enables both out-of-the-box by
ensuring data consistency when indexing the data and making it available for
search in real-time.

## Conclusion

After reading this article, you now know more about the different ways to
maximize the performance of your e-commerce applications. To summarize, low
latency and a good search experience are the most crucial to making your app
stand out.

However, efficiently handling the complex data modeling needs of an e-commerce
app while preventing a consistent and real-time search experience can be
challenging for developers with the existing choice of database technologies
available. Tigris simplifies the application development by providing a
flexible document store with strictly serializable transactions and
automatically enabling real-time search across your data stores.
