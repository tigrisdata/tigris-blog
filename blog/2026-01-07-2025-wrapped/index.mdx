2025 has been a breakthrough year for Tigris. Growth exploded, not just in
users, but in the product itself. Tigris has matured into the storage backbone
for leading AI companies like [fal.ai](http://fal.ai),
[Hedra](https://www.hedra.com/), and [Krea](https://www.krea.ai/), and now
powers
[Railway Storage Buckets](https://docs.railway.com/guides/storage-buckets) as
the underlying storage layer.

And the pace is only accelerating. This year, we announced our
[$25M Series A](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/series-a/) to take on Big Cloud
by rethinking how storage should work for AI workloads. Big Cloud providers
tightly couple storage to their own compute platforms, creating lock-in and
limiting how teams build and scale modern systems. We believe storage should be
independent, globally performant, and designed to run wherever the best compute
lives.

In 2025, Tigris crossed an important threshold. We became a **production-grade,
high-performance foundation.** Storage shouldn't dictate architecture or limit
ambition. It should fade into the background and just work.

We're deeply grateful to the customers who trusted us and pushed us forward.
Everything we shipped this year was driven by one belief: **we can build a
better future for the cloud**.

Here's a look at what we were up to in 2025.

## What we shipped

In 2025, we shipped _a lot_ of features. To name a few:

- [Tigris Storage SDKs](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/storage-sdk/)
- [Tigris MCP Server](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/hosted-mcp/)
- [mcp-oidc-provider](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/mcp-oidc-provider/)
- [TigrisFS](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/tigrisfs/)
- [Lifecycle Rules](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/lifecycle-rules/)
- [Partner Integration API](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/partner-integrations/)
- [Unhateable IAM](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/iam-policy-builder/)
- [1-click Bucket Sharing](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/bucket-sharing/)

But my favorite feature is
[Bucket Forks & Snapshots](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/fork-buckets-like-code/),
a new storage primitive that brings Git-like workflows to object storage.

## Favorite feature: bucket forks & snapshots

In 2025, we introduced a new storage primitive: bucket forks. Zero-copy clones
of your buckets, seeded by an immutable snapshot.

Forks and snapshots bring **data version control** to object storage — something
the ecosystem has long lacked. Unlike external catalog systems or overlays,
versioning is native to Tigris's storage layer.

With forks, experimentation is cheap and mistakes are easy to undo. But this is
not just about developer convenience. As AI systems become more autonomous and
collaborative, data needs to behave differently. Agents need isolated views of
the world. Teams need to explore multiple hypotheses in parallel. Systems need
to reason about state, history, and reproducibility as first-class concepts.

Bucket forks and snapshots were built with that future in mind. They enable
autonomous agents, multi-agent collaboration, and stateful AI systems at scale.
By pushing these concepts into the storage layer, we remove complexity from
application code and make new classes of systems possible.

If you want the deep technical story, from the append-only foundations to the
architectural tradeoffs that make cheap forking possible, this post captures the
philosophy and architecture behind it:

## Best developer experience: Tigris storage SDKs

This year, we released our Typescript and JavaScript
[Storage SDKs](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/storage-sdk/) and
[Python boto3 extension](https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigris-boto3-ext). It
automatically figures out where to store things, what credentials to use, and
all the other minutæ you have to deal with. You just put, get, list, and delete
objects, so you get code you can read with a glance.

## Biggest unlock for MCP developers: mcp-oidc-provider

Setting up proper OAuth for our hosted MCP server ended up being a lot harder
than we thought it would be. That's why we open sourced our
[mcp-oidc-provider](https://github.com/tigrisdata/mcp-oidc-provider): a minimal,
production-ready OIDC provider designed specifically for MCP workflows. Plug in
any IdP you want; it's vendor neutral, just like Tigris.

## Biggest win: performance

We
[benchmarked Tigris against S3 and R2](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/benchmark-small-objects/)
and found we're **5.3x faster** than S3 and **86.6x faster** than R2 for the
small objects common in AI workloads. And throughput was 4x vs S3 and 20x vs R2.

We ran these benchmarks on compute that was not colocated with storage (i.e.,
not within Tigris or AWS), matching the workload pattern we see with many of our
customers, highly distributed compute across neoclouds. Don't take our word for
it: you can see
[the results](https://github.com/tigrisdata-community/ycsb-benchmarks) and run
the benchmark yourself.

This validated years of architectural decisions — from global replication to
owning more of the stack — and reinforced that performance and simplicity don't
have to be tradeoffs.

## Coolest experience: we met you IRL

We got to meet you! As a mostly remote company, meeting in person is a special
treat. We talked tech at conferences, gave out Ty the Tiger crochet kits, and
plastered your laptops with stickers.

## Engineering blog posts our readers loved most

One of the highlights of 2025 was seeing engineers dive deep into our technical
writing. Our most-read posts unpacked the architectural decisions behind Tigris,
especially where AI workloads break traditional storage assumptions.

## What's Next in 2026

2026 is shaping up to be another big year for AI. And the storage layer powering
it needs to keep up.

We are doubling down on what makes Tigris different: storage that actively
enables new architectures instead of constraining them. Bucket forks, snapshots,
and TigrisFS open the door to higher-level primitives for AI-native workflows,
and we are just beginning to explore what that makes possible.

Like the Tigris river gave rise to civilization, we're also starting something
new.
