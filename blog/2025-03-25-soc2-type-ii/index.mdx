Tigris has achieved SOC 2 Type II certification, signifying our high standard
for security and operations. We have partnered with an independent third party
to thoroughly review our policies and procedures and verify our compliance.
We’re excited to provide secure object storage for everyone, whether you’re
storing megabytes or petabytes.

This wasn’t just a quick check-up: this was a deep dive into our security
measures, how we manage risks, and all of our day-to-day operations. SOC 2 is an
auditing framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (AICPA) to assess an organization’s controls over information
security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. SOC
2 Type II audits an organization’s systems, emphasizing the practical
implementation of these controls to verify their alignment with the applicable
trust services criteria.

These controls revolve around risk management and how to overcome it. Risks can
come in all shapes and sizes from people leaving the company, new people joining
the company, external attacks, compromised dependencies, and any number of other
factors. By getting our SOC 2 Type II certification, we prove that we treat your
data with the care and security it deserves.

In June of 2024, we were proud to share our SOC 2 Type I certification which
defines all the policies and procedures. Now, the SOC 2 Type II certification
showcases our ongoing commitment to upholding those standards.
