# Introducing the TERN stack and how to migrate from MERN to TERN

The MERN Stack - a web technology stack consisting of MongoDB, Express.js,
React, and Node.js - was introduced around 2018 as a popular set of technologies
to enable end-to-end development in JavaScript. Although the popularity of
fullstack frameworks such as Next.js *mean*s that MERN isn't as popular as it
once was, it is still a viable and productive choice with its decoupled
architecture providing more flexibility than you'll get with a fullstack
framework.

Today, I'd like to introduce the **TERN** (**T**igris, **E**xpress.js,
**R**eact, and **N**ode.js) stack which replaces MongoDB with Tigris.

[![Migrating from MERN to TERN](./mern-to-tern.png)](/blog/tern-stack/)

In this post, you'll learn about MERN and TERN and why you should migrate from
MERN to TERN. We'll cover all the steps involved in migrating a MERN application
to **TERN** (**T**igris, **E**xpress.js, **R**eact, and **N**ode.js); first
using
[Tigris MongoDB compatibility](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/concepts/mongodb-compatibility/)
to get your existing application working with Tigris instead of MongoDB without
any code changes (⚠️ spoiler: it's as simple as updating the MongoDB connection
string). Then, we'll make a few changes to get the application using the Tigris
SDK instead of the MongoDB Node.js driver, completing the migration.

## What is MERN?

**MERN** (**M**ongoDB, **E**xpress.js, **R**eact, and **N**ode.js) is an
alternative to the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js).
[MEAN was introduced](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/the-mean-stack-mongodb-expressjs-angularjs-and)
in 2013 and MERN followed as React became increasingly popular in 2018.

The MERN stack consists of:

- **Browser**: [React](https://react.dev/) with either JavaScript or TypeScript
  (transpiled to JavaScript)
- **Server**: [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) with either JavaScript or
  TypeScript (transpiled to JavaScript)
- **Database**: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) most likely using the
  MongoDB Node.js driver, although an ODM such as
  [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) maybe used.

## What is TERN?

**TERN** (**T**igris, **E**xpress.js, **R**eact, and **N**ode.js) takes the
ideas behind MERN and replaces MongoDB with Tigris.

- **Browser**: [React](https://react.dev/) with either JavaScript or TypeScript
  (transpiled to JavaScript)
- **Server**: [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) with either JavaScript or
  TypeScript (transpiled to JavaScript)
- **Database**:
  [Tigris Database](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/concepts/database/) using
  the
  [Tigris TypeScript SDK](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdkstools/typescript/)
  which provides an in-built ODM.

## Why migrate from MERN to TERN?

So, why would you migrate from MERN (MongoDB) to TERN (Tigris)? Tigris is a
serverless NoSQL database and search platform and an **alternative to MongoDB**.

Tigris has several benefits over MongoDB. Tigris:

- Takes a code-first approach to
  [database schema modeling](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdkstools/typescript/database/datamodel/)
  and
  [search index modeling](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdkstools/typescript/search/datamodel/).
- Supports
  [database branching](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdkstools/typescript/database/branching/)
  to fit into your development workflow.
- Removes the need for manual cluster provisioning and shard management.
- Supports
  [ACID transactions without caveats](/blog/transaction-internals-tigris/).
- Provides the same full-text search functionality whether you are using Tigris
  Cloud or self-hosting. The
  [MongoDB text search](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/text-search/)
  functionality differs between MongoDB Atlas and self-hosted MongoDB.
- Has been built with a modern cloud-native architecture, meaning the running
  costs are lower than MongoDB.

Convinced? If yes, fantastic! If not,
[let us know why](https://www.tigris.com/contact/).

## How to migrate from MERN to TERN

To follow along, you'll need the following:

- [Node.js LTS or above](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed
- A <a href={tigrisConfig.signUpUrl}>Tigris Cloud account</a> or a
  [self-hosted instance of Tigris](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/concepts/platform/self-host/).
  This tutorial will assume you're using Tigris Cloud.

For this tutorial, we'll use a forked and slightly updated version of the
[MongoDB MERN example](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/mern-stack-example)
used in the
[official MongoDB MERN stack guide](https://www.mongodb.com/languages/mern-stack-tutorial).

The
[updates that have been applied](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/mern-stack-example/compare/f321a6c995e4a70561003796440d9c877341be8f...829f55aaebbc419c252dbe5419e8733cf9cabe65)
are to use the newest version of the MongoDB Node.js driver (for MongoDB 6.0+
wire protocol support), remove the unused Mongoose ODM dependency, update the
code to use Promises, define the database name in an environment variable, use
`encodeURIComponent` when passing parameters in URLs from the client, and add
`alt` tags to images (not essential for this tutorial, but it felt like the
right thing to do).

To follow along, clone the updated
[TERN stack example repo](https://github.com/tigrisdata-community/tern-stack-example)
and switch to the `mern` branch:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tigrisdata-community/tern-stack-example.git
cd tern-stack-example
git checkout mern
```

If you have a MongoDB instance running, you can try the MERN example out by
following the instructions in the README.

We can now begin the migration.

You can migrate from MERN to TERN (and from any MongoDB application to Tigris)
in either a one or two-step process.

The two-step process, and the process covered here, is:

1. [Start by using Tigris MongoDB Compatibility](#mongodb-compatibility)
2. [Migrating your code to using the Tigris TypeScript SDK](#sdk)

### Using Tigris MongoDB Compatibility {#mongodb-compatibility}

We recently released
[Tigris MongoDB compatibility in beta](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/mongodb-compatibility-beta/)
which allows you to connect to Tigris using the MongoDB 6.0+ wire protocol. From
a MERN perspective, this probably means an application that is using the
[MongoDB Node.js driver](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/).

<p>
  Updating the application we've just cloned to use Tigris MongoDB Compatibility
  is as simple as updating the connection string. So, head to the
  <a href={tigrisConfig.consoleUrl}>Tigris Console</a> and create a new project.
  You'll then land in your project's **Getting Started** section. From there, click
  the **MongoDB Compatibility** tab and the MongoDB connection string that you see
  on that tab.
</p>

Either update or create a `mern/server/config.env` file, setting the value of
`ATLAS_URI` to the Tigris MongoDB connection string. Also, set `DATABASE_NAME`
to the name of the Tigris project you just created. Your file will look similar
to the following:

```txt title="mern/server/config.env"
ATLAS_URI=mongodb://{TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID}:{TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET}@m1k.preview.tigrisdata.cloud:27018?authMechanism=PLAIN&tls=true
DATABASE_NAME=mern-to-tern
```

Then, follow the existing README instructions to start the server and the
client.

In one terminal, start the server with:

```sh
cd mern/server
npm install
npm start
```

<details>
<summary>Server command line output</summary>

```sh
$ npm start

> server@1.0.0 start
> node server.js

Server is running on port: 5000
Successfully connected to MongoDB.
```

</details>

In another terminal, start the client with:

```sh
cd mern/client
npm install
npm start
```

<details>
<summary>Client command line output</summary>

_Note: Some other dependencies could do with being updated._

```sh
Compiled with warnings.

Warning
(3769:3) autoprefixer: Replace color-adjust to print-color-adjust. The color-adjust shorthand is currently deprecated.

Search for the keywords to learn more about each warning.
To ignore, add // eslint-disable-next-line to the line before.

webpack compiled with 1 warning
```

</details>

When you run the client, the browser automatically opens the browser. By
default, the app will be running on `http://localhost:3000`. Try out the
application to see it in action.

import mernVideo from "./mern-app.mp4";

<video controls style={{ minWidth: "400px", width: "100%" }}>
  <source src={mernVideo} />
</video>

Please remember that all we've done to make this application work with Tigris
Database is updated the connection string to point to Tigris Cloud.

### Migrating from the MongoDB Node.js Driver to the Tigris SDK {#sdk}

Tigris MongoDB compatibility is a great first step in migrating a MERN
application. But, to take full advantage of TERN and Tigris, it's recommended
that the application is updated to use the
[Tigris TypeScript SDK](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdkstools/typescript/).
There's more work required to do this, but the changes are pretty small, as this
section will show.

Since the client and server are decoupled via the API that the Express.js
application exposes, we only need to update the code for the Express.js API
endpoints.

#### Update dependencies

Let's begin by updating the MERN application dependencies to use those required
by TERN; remove the `mongodb` driver and add `@tigrisdata/core`:

```sh
npm uninstall monodb
npm i @tigrisdata/core
```

#### Add Tigris Configuration

Update the `mern/server/config.env` file to contain additional Tigris config:

```diff title="mern/server/config.env"
- ATLAS_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@sandbox.jadwj.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
- DATABASE_NAME=mern-to-tern
PORT=5000
+ TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID={TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID}
+ TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET={TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET}
+ TIGRIS_PROJECT=mern-to-tern
+ TIGRIS_URI=api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud
+ TIGRIS_DB_BRANCH=main
```

Replacing `{TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID}` and `{TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET}` with real values
from your Tigris project application keys.

#### Define your database schema in TypeScript

Install TypeScript as a development dependency:

```sh
npm i -D typescript
```

Add the following to a `mern/server/tsconfig.json`:

```json title="mern/server/tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2016",
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "module": "commonjs",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  }
}
```

Define a schema in TypeScript to match the auto-generated schema that was
created when using the application via Tigris MongoDB compatibility:

```ts
import {
  Field,
  PrimaryKey,
  TigrisCollection,
  TigrisDataTypes,
} from "@tigrisdata/core";

@TigrisCollection("records")
export class Record {
  @Field({ elements: TigrisDataTypes.STRING })
  $k?: string[];

  @PrimaryKey(TigrisDataTypes.BYTE_STRING, { order: 1, autoGenerate: true })
  _id?: string;

  @Field()
  name!: string;

  @Field()
  position!: string;

  @Field()
  level!: string;
}
```

The `@TigrisCollection("records")` decorator and supplied `records` value
informs Tigris that there is a `records` collection of documents of type
`Record` in the structure defined by that class.

The fields `_id`, `name`, `position`, and `level`, are all used within the
application. The `$k` field isn't used but is required to allow the application
to continue to work with the auto-generated MongoDB compatibility schema. As
you'll see, all the application's fields are of type `string`.

:::tip

You can also grab this schema from the <a href={tigrisConfig.consoleUrl}>Tigris
Console</a> under **Your Project** -> **Database** -> click on the **records**
schema -> select **TypeScript** from the drop down:

![The record schema defined in TypeScript within the Tigris Console](./tigris-console-schema.png)

:::

With the schema in place, we need to validate it with Tigris and use it with the
Tigris TypeScript SDK. To do that, create a `mern/server/script/setup.ts` script
with the following contents:

```ts title="mern/server/scripts/setup.ts"
import { Tigris } from "@tigrisdata/core";
import { Record } from "../db/record";

import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config({ path: "./config.env" });

async function main() {
  // setup client
  const tigrisClient = new Tigris();
  // ensure branch exists, create it if it needs to be created dynamically
  await tigrisClient.getDatabase().initializeBranch();
  // register schemas
  await tigrisClient.registerSchemas([Record]);
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    console.log("Setup complete ...");
    process.exit(0);
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

In the above code, the config is loaded using `dotenv`, and a `Tigris` client is
instantiated and assigned to the `tigrisClient` variable, which uses the loaded
environment variables. Then, the database and database branch are initialized by
`tigrisClient.getDatabase().initializeBranch()`. Finally, register the `Record`
schema via `tigrisClient.registerSchemas([Record])`.

Update the `package.json` to make use of the setup script:

```diff
{
  "name": "server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
+   "setup": "npx ts-node scripts/setup.ts",
+   "prestart": "npm run setup",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
+   "@tigrisdata/core": "^1.0.0-beta.44",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^8.2.0",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
-   "mongodb": "5.2",
-   "mongoose": "^5.12.4"
+   "reflect-metadata": "^0.1.13"
+ },
+ "devDependencies": {
+   "typescript": "^5.0.4"
  }
}
```

This adds a `setup` NPM script utilized by `prestart`, which is automatically
before the script defined in the `start` NPM script.

_Note: the above diff also shows the other changed dependencies._

With the schema defined, we can move on to updating the application code.

#### Update the connection code

Next, update the connection code defined in `mern/server/db/conn.js` by removing
the MongoDB Node.js driver and updating the code to use the Tigris TypeScript
SDK:

```diff title="mern/server/db/conn.js"
- const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");
- const Db = process.env.ATLAS_URI;
+ const { Tigris } = require("@tigrisdata/core");

- const client = new MongoClient(Db, {
-   useNewUrlParser: true,
-   useUnifiedTopology: true,
- });
+ const client = new Tigris();

var _db;

module.exports = {
  connectToServer: async function (callback) {
    try {
-     const db = await client.connect();
-     _db = db.db(process.ENV.DATABASE_NAME);
-     console.log("Successfully connected to MongoDB.");
+     _db = await client.getDatabase();
+     console.log("Successfully connected to Tigris.");
      return callback();
    } catch (err) {
      return callback(err);
```

The `Tigris` client is instantiated and automatically uses the environment
variables we've defined in the `mern/server/config.env` file.

The other difference worth pointing out is that we don't name the database that
is being used in `client.getDatabase()` since each Tigris Project has only one
database.

#### Common MERN to TERN code changes

A consistent difference across all of the Express.js route changes are:

1. The MongoDB `ObjectId` is no longer used
1. The query contains a `filter` to identify the document. So, from
   `{ _id: new ObjectId(req.params.id) }` to
   `{ filter: { _id: req.params.id } }` is a consistent code change in all
   routes
1. Collections are accessed via `getCollection(collectionName)` instead of
   `collection(collectionName)`

#### Migrate MERN database read to TERN database read

Update the `GET /record` route:

```diff title="mern/server/routes/record.js"
- const ObjectId = require("mongodb").ObjectId;

// This section will help you get a list of all the records.
recordRoutes.route("/record").get(async function (req, res) {
- let db_connect = dbo.getDb("employees");
- const result = await db_connect.collection("records").find({}).toArray();
+ let db_connect = dbo.getDb();
+ const result = await db_connect.getCollection("records").findMany().toArray();

  return res.json(result);
});
```

To retrieve multiple documents using the Tigris SDK use
[`findMany`](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdkstools/typescript/database/query/#find-many),
passing no parameters. This returns a cursor that exposes a `toArray` function
to get an `Array` of results.

If you restart the server application, you'll see the main application page
displaying the employees but via a call to `GET /record` which now uses the
Tigris SDK.

#### Migrate MERN database create to TERN database create

Update the `POST /record/add` route:

_Note: To be more faithful to REST, this should be `POST /record`_

```diff title="mern/server/routes/record.js"
recordRoutes.route("/record/add").post(async function (req, res) {
  let db_connect = dbo.getDb();
  let myobj = {
    name: req.body.name,
    position: req.body.position,
    level: req.body.level,
  };

- const result = db_connect.collection("records").insertOne(myobj);
+ const result = await db_connect.getCollection("records").insertOne(myobj);
  res.json(result);
});
```

In this case, the method signature for
[`insertOne`](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdkstools/typescript/database/insert/#insert-a-single-document)
stays the same.

#### Migrate MERN database update to TERN database update

Change the `POST /update/:id` route:

_Note: To be more RESTful, this should be `PATCH /record/:id` or
`PATCH /record/:id` if it replaces the whole resource._

```diff title="mern/server/routes/record.js"
recordRoutes.route("/update/:id").post(async function (req, res) {
  let db_connect = dbo.getDb();
- let myquery = { _id: new ObjectId(req.params.id) };
- let newvalues = {
+ const myquery = {
+   filter: { _id: req.params.id },
+   fields: {
      $set: {
        name: req.body.name,
        position: req.body.position,
        level: req.body.level,
      },
+   },
  };
- const result = await db_connect
-   .collection("records")
-   .updateOne(myquery, newvalues);
+ const result = await db_connect.getCollection("records").updateOne(myquery);

  console.log("1 document updated");
  res.json(result);
});
```

The
[`updateOne`](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdkstools/typescript/database/update/#update-one)
Tigris SDK function differs from the MongoDB Node.js driver in that, it takes a
single parameter with the following properties to achieve the same result:

1. `filter` the filter used to find the single document to be updated
2. `fields` where this property can use the `$set` syntax supported by the
   MongoDB driver.

#### Migrate MERN database delete to TERN database delete

Finally, update the `DELETE /:id` route:

_Note: REST police: this should be `DELETE /record/:id`_

```diff title="mern/server/routes/record.js"
recordRoutes.route("/:id").delete(async (req, res) => {
  let db_connect = dbo.getDb();
- let myquery = { _id: new ObjectId(req.params.id) };
- const result = await db_connect.collection("records").deleteOne(myquery);
+ let myquery = { filter: { _id: req.params.id } };
+ const result = await db_connect.getCollection("records").deleteOne(myquery);

  res.json(result);
});
```

As discussed, the only change here is the `filter` required by the Tigris SDK.

#### Update the logo

Let's add the Tigris logo 😄 Grab the
[Tigris green logo](https://tigrisdata.notion.site/Tigris-logo-green-f2ea7a90123749e88c1b78040902f88f),
save it to `tern/client/public` and update
`mern/client/src/components/navbar.js` as follows:

```diff title="mern/client/src/components/navbar.js"
<NavLink className="navbar-brand" to="/">
  <img
-   alt="MongoDB logo"
+   alt="Tigris logo"
    style={{ width: 25 + "%" }}
-   src="https://d3cy9zhslanhfa.cloudfront.net/media/3800C044-6298-4575-A05D5C6B7623EE37/4B45D0EC-3482-4759-82DA37D8EA07D229/webimage-8A27671A-8A53-45DC-89D7BF8537F15A0D.png"
+   src="/tigris-logo-green.png"
  ></img>
</NavLink>
```

#### Run the TERN application

And with those updates applied, the MERN application is converted to the TERN
stack 🎉

Since there are no functional changes to the front-end (only the logo update),
you only need to stop and start the server only to see the changes in action:

```sh
npm start
```

And you'll see the following output:

```sh
npm start

> server@1.0.0 prestart
> npm run setup


> server@1.0.0 setup
> npx ts-node scripts/setup.ts

info - Using reflection to infer type of Record#$k
info - Using reflection to infer type of Record#name
info - Using reflection to infer type of Record#position
info - Using reflection to infer type of Record#level
info - Using Tigris at: api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud:443

> server@1.0.0 start
> node server.js

info - Using Tigris at: api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud:443
Server is running on port: 5000
Successfully connected to Tigris.
```

Navigate to the client URL, which by default is `http://localhost:3000`, and try
out the TERN app (we did refresh the client so the Tigris logo is present in
this video):

import ternVideo from "./tern-app.mp4";

<video controls style={{ minWidth: "400px", width: "100%" }}>
  <source src={ternVideo} />
</video>

If you have a look at the <a href={tigrisConfig.consoleUrl}>Tigris Console</a>
and explore the data, as shown in the video, you'll see the `_id` values are
structured differently, and the `$k` value is not populated for documents
created via the Tigris SDK.

Besides the logo, the application looks and performs exactly as the MERN
application did. However, as the intro outlines, you can now also take advantage
of the benefits of using Tigris.

You can find all the code changes applied to migrate the MongoDB MERN
application to TERN in
[this diff](https://github.com/tigrisdata-community/tern-stack-example/compare/mern...b483e24?w=1).

## Next Steps

How about raising a pull request to add full-text search to the TERN application
using
[Tigris Search](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdkstools/typescript/search/)?

What should we call the Tigris version of MEAN? No, I've got it; it has to be
**NEAT**!

Join the <a href={tigrisConfig.discordUrl}>Tigris Discord</a> and let us know
what you think of TERN and the process of migrating a MERN (or any other
MongoDB) application over to TERN.

Tigris is an open-source serverless NoSQL database and search platform. If you
