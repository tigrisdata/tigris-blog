title: Becoming your own Docker Registry with Tigris
description: >
  Tigris lets you store your objects around the world so that you beat the speed
  of light getting your data to your users faster. Sometimes those include
  Docker images so that you can spin up more GPU time without having to download
  or manage your models separately. Join on in and learn how you can become your
  own Docker registry!

Docker is the universal package format of the internet. When you deploy software
to your computers, chances are you build your app into a container image and
deploy it through either Docker or something that understands the same formats
that Docker uses. However, this is where they get you: Docker image storage in
the cloud is not free. Docker registries also have strict image size limits and
will charge you egress fees based on the size of your images.

What if you could host your own registry though? What if when doing it you could
actually get a better experience than you get with the hosted registries on the
big cloud.

Thankfully, the
[Docker Registry](https://distribution.github.io/distribution/about/) program
can be self-hosted, and one of the storage backends it supports is S3. You can
use Tigris instead of S3 to pull images as fast as possible.

Today, we'll be setting up a Docker registry backed by Tigris so you can push
Docker images of any size into the cloud.

## Making your own Docker Registry on fly.io

In order to make the registry, you need a fly.io account.
[Sign up](https://fly.io/app/sign-up) and then use
[this link](https://fly.io/hello/tigris?utm_campaign=docker-registry) to get $50
of compute credit on us.

Make a new folder in your code folder for the registry:

```text
mkdir -p registry && cd registry
```

Then set up our template with `fly launch`:

```text
fly launch --from=https://github.com/tigrisdata-community/docker-registry --no-deploy
```

You won't need to tweak the settings.

Create a tigris bucket using `fly storage create`:

```text
fly storage create
```

Let Tigris pick a bucket name and then copy the secrets to your notes. You
should get output like this:

```text
Your Tigris project (adjective-noun-1234) is ready. See details and next steps with: https://fly.io/docs/reference/tigris/

Setting the following secrets on tigris-registry:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: tid_AzureDiamond
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3: https://fly.storage.tigris.dev
AWS_REGION: auto
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: tsec_hunter2hunter2hunter2
BUCKET_NAME: delicate-sea-639
```

Copy the variables over according to this table:

| Fly storage create secret |  →  | Environment variable in `.env`  |
| ------------------------: | :-: | :------------------------------ |
|             `BUCKET_NAME` |  →  | `REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET`    |
|       `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` |  →  | `REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_ACCESSKEY` |
|   `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` |  →  | `REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_SECRETKEY` |

```shell
# Change these settings
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET=bucketName
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_ACCESSKEY=tid_accessKey
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_SECRETKEY=tsec_secretAccessKey

# Don't change these settings
REGISTRY_STORAGE=s3
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_REGION=auto
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_REGIONENDPOINT=https://fly.storage.tigris.dev
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_FORCEPATHSTYLE=false
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_ENCRYPT=false
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_SECURE=true
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_V4AUTH=true
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_CHUNKSIZE=5242880
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_ROOTDIRECTORY=/
```

Write this to `.env` in your current working directory.

Then import the secrets into your app:

```shell
fly secrets import < .env
```

And add a randomly generated HTTP secret:

```shell
fly secret set REGISTRY_HTTP_SECRET=$(uuidgen || uuid)
```

Now you can deploy it:

```shell
fly deploy --no-ha
```

Once it’s up, you can push and pull like normal.

## Storing models in images

Now that we have a private Docker registry, let's give it a whirl with smollm.
Clone the example models repo and build smollm:

```
docker build -t your-registry.fly.dev/models/smollm/135m:q4 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tigrisdata-community/models-in-docker/refs/heads/main/smollm/Dockerfile
```

Then push it to your registry:

```
docker push your-registry.fly.dev/models/smollm/135m:q4
```

Then try to launch it with `fly machine run`:

```text
fly machine run \
  -r sea \
  --vm-size l40s \
  --vm-gpu-kind l40s \
  your-registry.fly.dev/models/smollm:135m-q4
```

Copy the IP address to your clipboard (it should look like this:
`fdaa:0:641b:a7b:29b:b5b0:2009:2`) and run `fly proxy` to get to it:

```text
fly proxy 8000 fdaa:0:641b:a7b:29b:b5b0:2009:2
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and try it out!

Once you're done, make sure to destroy the machine with `fly machine destroy`:

```text
fly machine destroy
```

Select the one in Seattle that's marked as running. Your registry should have
went to sleep while you were experimenting.

## Securing the registry

Right now this registry is open for anyone in the world to pull from and push to
it. This is not ideal. In lack of a better option, we're going to use htpasswd
authentication for the registry. In order to get this set up, we need to shut
down the registry for a moment:

```
fly scale count 0
```

And then start an ephemeral Alpine Machine with the htpasswd volume mounted:

```
fly machine run --shell --command /bin/sh alpine
```

Once you're in, install the apache2-utils package to get the htpasswd command:

```
apk -U add apache2-utils
```

Then create a password for your administrator user:

```
htpasswd -B -c /data/htpasswd admin
```

It'll ask you for your password and write the result to `/data/htpasswd`. Repeat
this for every person or bot that needs access to the registry. Make sure to
save these passwords to a password manager as you will not be able to recover
them later.

Once you're done, exit out of the Alpine Machine and configure these secrets so
that the Docker registry server will use that shiny new htpasswd file:

```
fly secrets set REGISTRY_AUTH=htpasswd REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM=basic-realm REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH=/data/htpasswd
```

Then turn the registry back on:

```
fly scale count 1
```

Finally, log into your registry with docker login:

```
docker login tigris-registry.fly.dev -u admin
```

Paste your password, hit enter, and you're in\!

Here's what people without authentication will see:

```
$ docker run --rm -it tigris-registry.fly.dev/alpine
Unable to find image 'tigris-registry.fly.dev/alpine:latest' locally
docker: Error response from daemon: failed to resolve reference "tigris-registry.fly.dev/alpine:latest": pull access denied, repository does not exist or may require authorization: authorization failed: no basic auth credentials.
See 'docker run --help'.
```

## Conclusion

Today we learned how to make your own Docker image repository. You can use this
to store anything (not just large language model inference servers). Plop it
into your CI flows and see what it does!
