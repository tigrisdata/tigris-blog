# Real-Time Search: What It Is and When You Need It

Google first introduced a real-time search function to its search engine
over a decade ago (2010). Today, it is virtually impossible to imagine
Google without it. Yet, strangely, real-time and live searches aren't as
widespread as they should be. The only real players with comprehensive
real-time search capabilities are social media platforms and search engines.
App and web developers often avoid adding this functionality because it is
either too difficult or they feel it's unnecessary. However, it can be
highly useful for e-commerce apps and websites that consistently post fresh
content (such as blogs). The last decade saw a shift in the software
industry's priorities as greater emphasis has been placed on user experience
(UX) and UI design. Knowing how and when to implement real-time search is a
crucial skill to have as a modern developer. The following guide will
explore what it is and where and when to use it.

## What Is Real-Time Search?

Most website and app full-text search functions use indexes that are
routinely updated by crawlers. However, this approach is unsuitable for
social media sites like Twitter, where new content is published every second.
There are at least
[350,000 Tweets posted](https://blog.hootsuite.com/twitter-statistics/)
every second. Twitter manages popular and relevant content using (hashtag)
trends and its real-time search feature.

Modern search engines connect you to websites that are continuously updating,
so a real-time search function is a valuable feature. Initially, Google
offered this function through its dedicated Realtime search website. However,
the website was decommissioned in 2016, and many of its features were
repurposed and refined for [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/)
. On the other hand, Bing uses real-time search functionality for its
vertical searches (news and tiles) and
[keyword research tool](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/keyword-research-628070b6) to help identify trends.

Recently, there has been some discourse and debate on what real-time search
is. While some believe that defining real-time search as a feature that
finds content (real-time content) as it is published is sufficient, others
believe that true real-time search finds content as it's being created,
written, or updated.

Real-time or live search retrieves the latest relevant content. While this
is possible with shared code repositories and SaaS products that allow
multiple parties to collaborate on content creation (such as Google Docs),
it's harder to achieve at large scales. Nevertheless, this distinction is
ultimately inconsequential.

### Real-Time Search vs. Autosuggest

Many users confuse autocomplete or autosuggest with real-time search. While
they're completely different, these two features can share a relationship.
Autocomplete refers to a text box (typically a search box) that completes
search phrases for you using an internal index. Autosuggest uses past
searches and search trends to retrieve suggestions to help you complete your
search phrase or select related content.

If autosuggest or autocomplete uses trends to populate its suggestions, it
may use the real-time search functionality in the background. Likewise,
autocomplete and autosuggest are often used in real-time search boxes.

## Use Cases for Real-Time Search

Besides search engines and social media platforms, there are many scenarios
where real-time search can be helpful, and the following are just a few
examples:

### In E-commerce

Amazon is the king of e-commerce and will likely remain so for years. It
operates in thirteen countries and has over
[nine million sellers](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-seller-statistics/)
worldwide. Amazon has an estimated twelve million products in its inventory.
Amazon Marketplace has at least 350 million products on sale. Its inventory and
stock are constantly changing.

With product and stock counts constantly in flux, live-search functionality
is a strong advantage for e-commerce websites like Amazon.com. It could
bring back results based on the latest promotions, the amount of stock left,
written reviews, etc.

Amazon uses real-time search for its Amazon Live feature. Your e-commerce
website could benefit from real-time search in the same way. It can be used
to return the most popular items based on which ones are purchased, reviewed,
or wish-listed the most. Real-time search functionality can be particularly
useful for holiday shopping seasons - especially Black Friday and Cyber
Monday, where stock availability can change abruptly. Real-time search can
ensure that your site visitors get the most relevant results for product
queries. This can translate to quicker conversions and boosted sales.
Furthermore, it can minimize situations where sold-out stock is erroneously
displayed as in stock because of a caching, late update, or UI issue.

### Location-Based Search

Google Maps is famous for being one of the first mapping mobile apps to use
real-time data to track traffic and determine the best routes for users to
take. Location-based search functions on the same principle and can be
used in autocomplete or autosuggestions to facilitate what is known as
[Geosearch](https://opencagedata.com/guides/what-is-geosearch). It can
determine trends based on your location and then populate its full-text
search suggestions with geographically relevant recommendations.

Uber Technologies, chiefly famous for its revolutionary ride-hailing service,
uses real-time features in many of its services. The most obvious example is
the Uber app - Request a Ride feature, which displays a map with all the
available cars in your area in real-time. This real-time data determines
which ride is best for your trip.

Recently, we've seen real-time location-based searches used in epidemiology
to track and contain the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Mapping apps were
created to inform people of virus hotspots and vaccination sites.

Alternatively, users can initiate these searches and access breaking news or
relevant information about their surroundings. Location-based searches can
provide real-time actionable insights if there is a terrorist threat, fire,
demonstration, etc., nearby.

Of course, real-time search can also be used for recreation and leisure
activities. Users can find the nearest shopping center or a restaurant and
potentially the number of people there, allowing them to determine if there
is a wait or not.

## Why You Need Real-Time Search

Almost all modern GUI applications have some form of search or find
functionality. Search is a crucial software feature and should be seen as
mandatory. Thus, the conversation isn't about whether you have search
functionality; it's about how advanced and responsive it is.

But how should you go about integrating real-time search? Do you even have
the infrastructure or budget to build a fully custom real-time search
feature from scratch? This is where a service like Tigris comes in.

## Real-Time Search with Tigris

One of the biggest obstacles that software developers face when building
highly complex real-time search engines and functions is matching the right
tools with their data infrastructure. Often, they'll find themselves trying
to create processes that efficiently collect and compile information from a
range of disparate data sources. Tigris helps developers forgo this practice
and the headaches that come with it.

Tigris is a data platform built for developers. Tigris provides an embedded
full-text search engine that gives developers a seamless and scalable
experience for building rich search experiences in their applications. They
can search across all the data stores automatically using full text or
faceted search. And the embedded search engine eliminates the need to run a
separate search system alongside your database.
