## Why you need a dedicated search product

### Less formal

Database search serves its purpose when it comes to retrieving specific
information from structured datasets. However, it does come with certain
limitations that make dedicated search products a more favorable choice in many
scenarios. Let's delve into why utilizing a dedicated search product is
advantageous:

First and foremost, database search has its fair share of constraints. It
typically relies on structured query languages like SQL, demanding precise
keyword matching and exact criteria. This poses challenges when dealing with
complex search scenarios involving natural language queries, fuzzy matching,
relevance ranking, or unstructured data, as it is not well-suited for such
tasks.

Furthermore, scalability can become an issue with database search. As datasets
grow in size and complexity, performance can suffer, leading to slower search
results and increased processing overhead. This can impede efficiency and hinder
time-sensitive operations.

Moreover, databases are primarily designed for structured data, making it
challenging to handle unstructured or semi-structured data types such as text
documents, multimedia files, or web content. To effectively search through such
data, additional processing and indexing capabilities are required, which are
not inherently present in traditional databases.

In contrast, dedicated search products offer distinct advantages. They are
purpose-built to address these limitations and provide advanced search
functionality. Consider the following benefits:

1. Enhanced search capabilities: Dedicated search products employ sophisticated
   search algorithms and techniques, including full-text search, relevance
   ranking, faceted search, spell correction, and semantic analysis. These
   capabilities enable more accurate and comprehensive retrieval of information,
   particularly when dealing with unstructured or complex data.

2. Scalability and performance: Search products are designed to handle
   large-scale datasets efficiently. They utilize distributed architectures,
   indexing mechanisms, caching strategies, and parallel processing to deliver
   fast and scalable search results, even when dealing with massive amounts of
   data.

3. Support for diverse data types: Dedicated search products excel in handling
   various data types, encompassing unstructured and semi-structured data. They
   provide tools for data ingestion, preprocessing, and indexing, enabling
   effective search across multiple formats and sources.

4. Advanced analytics and insights: Many search products offer additional
   features such as data visualization, statistical analysis, and integration
   with machine learning capabilities. These functionalities empower businesses
   to derive deeper insights from their data, uncovering patterns or trends that
   may not be readily apparent through traditional database search methods.

5. User-friendly interfaces: Dedicated search products often come equipped with
   user-friendly interfaces, query builders, and search APIs, simplifying user
   interactions with the search system. This accessibility enables non-technical
   users to perform complex searches and obtain relevant results more
   effectively.

In summary, while database search serves its purpose for structured data
retrieval, dedicated search products outshine it in terms of handling diverse
data types, providing advanced search capabilities, ensuring scalability, and
offering additional features that enhance search experiences and enable deeper
insights.

### Format

While database search can be useful for retrieving specific information from
structured datasets, it does have certain shortfalls that make dedicated search
products preferable in many cases. Here are some limitations of database search:

1. Limited search capabilities: Traditional database search typically relies on
   structured query languages (e.g., SQL) that require precise matching of
   keywords or exact criteria. This makes it difficult to handle more complex
   search scenarios involving natural language queries, fuzzy matching,
   relevance ranking, and handling unstructured data.
2. Lack of scalability: Database search may struggle with scalability as the
   size of the dataset grows. As the number of records and complexity of
   relationships increase, performance can degrade, leading to slower search
   results and increased processing overhead.
3. Inability to handle diverse data types: Databases are designed for structured
   data, which means they may struggle with unstructured or semi-structured data
   types such as text documents, multimedia files, or web content. Searching
   through such data effectively requires additional processing and indexing
   capabilities not inherent in traditional databases.
4. Limited text search features: While databases often support basic text search
   capabilities, they may lack advanced features like full-text indexing,
   stemming, synonym matching, or linguistic analysis. These features are
   essential for performing accurate and comprehensive searches over textual
   data.

Dedicated search products, on the other hand, are specifically designed to
address these limitations and provide advanced search functionality. Here are
some advantages of using dedicated search products:

1. Enhanced search capabilities: Dedicated search products offer sophisticated
   search algorithms and techniques, including full-text search, relevance
   ranking, faceted search, spell correction, and semantic analysis. These
   capabilities enable more accurate and comprehensive retrieval of information,
   especially in scenarios involving unstructured or complex data.
2. Scalability and performance: Search products are built to handle large-scale
   data sets efficiently. They employ distributed architectures, indexing
   mechanisms, caching strategies, and parallel processing to deliver fast and
   scalable search results, even with massive amounts of data.
3. Support for diverse data types: Dedicated search products can handle various
   data types, including unstructured and semi-structured data. They provide
   tools for data ingestion, preprocessing, and indexing, allowing effective
   search across multiple formats and sources.
4. Advanced analytics and insights: Many search products offer additional
   features such as data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine
   learning integration. These capabilities enable businesses to gain deeper
   insights from their data and uncover patterns or trends that may not be
   apparent through traditional database search.
5. User-friendly interfaces: Dedicated search products often come with
   user-friendly interfaces, query builders, and search APIs, making it easier
   for users to interact with the search system. This accessibility empowers
   non-technical users to perform complex searches and obtain relevant results
   more effectively.

So, while database search serves its purpose for structured data retrieval,
dedicated search products such as Tigris Search are better for handling diverse
data types, providing advanced search capabilities, ensuring scalability, and
offering additional features that enhance search experiences and enable deeper
insights.
