Database search is okay, at best. To build awesome search experiences you need a
dedicated search product.

Earlier this month we
[released Tigris Search in BETA](/blog/tigris-database-search-sync-beta/) and
covered how it supports automatic synchronization infrastructure. between Tigris
Database and Tigris Search, which improves developer productivity by enabling
the team to focus on shipping features and not setting up and managing search
and synchronization infrastructure.

However, you may be looking to quickly enhance your application experience by
adding search capabilities using existing data without waiting to migrate your
database to Tigris. Or, your data may not be in a database, and it's in some
other type of data store, such as S3.

Whatever the reason, the Tigris Standalone Search feature allows you to quickly
add search to your existing data.

## Tigris Standalone Search was released with Tigris Search BETA

As part of our release of Tigris Search BETA we also made it possible for you to
take advantage of
[Tigris Search as a standalone feature](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/concepts/searching/#standalone-search).

Tigris Standalone Search can be used with any existing data store via
integrating with our APIs and SDKs. This gives you full control to determine
which indexes you create and maintain.

Here are some examples in TypeScript that demonstrate how to use Tigris
Standalone Search. For a more in-depth example and a demo, checkout the
[search demo](#search-demo) below.

Define your
[Search data model](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdkstools/typescript/database/datamodel/):

```ts
export const CATALOG_INDEX_NAME = "catalog";

@TigrisSearchIndex(CATALOG_INDEX_NAME)
export class Catalog {
  @SearchField({ sort: true })
  name: string;

  @SearchField({ sort: true })
  price: number;

  @SearchField({ facet: true })
  brand: string;

  @SearchField({ elements: TigrisDataTypes.STRING, facet: true })
  @Field({ elements: TigrisDataTypes.STRING })
  tags: Array<string>;
}
```

Create your search index for the data model:

```ts
const client = new Tigris();
const search = client.getSearch();
const catalog = await search.createOrUpdateIndex<Catalog>(CATALOG_INDEX_NAME);
```

Insert a document in the search index:

```ts
const result = await catalog.createOne({
  name: "fiona handbag",
  price: 99.9,
  brand: "michael kors",
  tags: "purses",
});
```

That's it!

For more information, including indexing multiple documents, updating indexed
documents, and deleted indexed documents, see the
[TypeScript Standalone Search docs](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdkstools/typescript/search/).

## Awesome email search demo with Resend &amp; Tigris Search {#search-demo}

To demonstrate Tigris Search, we've created a demo application with Resend - an
API platform that enables developers to build, test, and deliver transactional
email at scale - that simulates a series of onboarding emails to be sent during
the onboarding journey.

1. Signed up = welcome
2. After trigger X or Y amount of time = join the community
3. After trigger X or Y amount of time = request feedback

import templateSelection from "./template-selection.mp4";

<video controls style={{ width: "100%" }}>
  <source src={templateSelection} />
</video>

After sending the emails, they are stored in a Tigris Search index. As the
status of the emails change (delivered, bounced, complained, opened, clicked),
Resend triggers a webhook which updates the Tigris search index with the updated
email status. You can search across all the attributes of an email document
within the Tigris Search index using:

- Full-text real-time search with fuzzy matching across all fields (status, to,
  from, subject, created [date], and email body)
- Filtering on email status
- Sorting by date
- Browsing via pagination

import search from "./search.mp4";

<video controls style={{ width: "100%" }}>
  <source src={search} />
</video>

It's a simple but powerful use case of Tigris standalone search.

You can:

- 🫢 Try out the
  [Awesome Email Search demo](https://awesome-email-search.vercel.app/)
- 💻 Grab the
  [Awesome Email Search code on GitHub](https://github.com/tigrisdata-community/awesome-email-search),

Or read through the code walk-through, below.

## How to send transactional email with Resend

The demo application is built using Next.js and makes use of the
[Next.js 13 App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing).

When the **Send** email form is submitted, a route handles the `POST` request.

```ts title=src/app/api/email/route.tsx
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  let emailIndex;
  let statusCode = 400;
  try {
    const formData = await request.formData();
    const stage = formData.get('stage');
    if (!stage) {
      throw new Error('"stage" is a required search parameter');
    }

    ...
```

In the code above, we define a `emailIndex` variable representing the Tigris
Search index we're going to create and also `statusCode` variable to hold the
status code to be used in the `POST` response. We grab the form data from the
`POST` request and extract the `stage` value. `stage` maps to the email we'll
send: "Welcome", "Join the community", or "Request feedback". The code also
checks that a required `stage` value was passed at all.

Next, we lookup the Resend email template and create the email:

```ts title=src/app/api/email/route.tsx
    if (!stage) {
      throw new Error('"stage" is a required search parameter');
    }

    const emailTemplate = EmailTemplates[stage as string];

    if (!emailTemplate) {
      throw new Error(`Could not find email template for stage "${stage}"`);
    }

    const body = emailTemplate.template({
      name: formData.get('name')?.valueOf() as string,
      link: formData.get('link')?.valueOf() as string,
    })!;
    log('created email');

    ...
```

Here, we perform a lookup based on the `stage` value and get a reference to the
email template details. The `template` property is a react component - yep,
Resend allows you to
[create emails using React](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-nextjs#2-create-an-email-template) -
and we create the body of the email, passing in `name` and `link` values that
have been submitted via the `POST` request.

Now that we have the email contents, we can send the email:

```ts title=src/app/api/email/route.tsx
    log('created email');

    const testEmailStatus = formData.get('testEmailStatus')
      ? TestEmailStatus[
          formData.get('testEmailStatus') as unknown as TestEmailStatus
        ]
      : '';
    log(
      'testEmailStatus',
      testEmailStatus,
      `[${formData.get('testEmailStatus')}]`
    );

    const sendEmailRequest: SendEmailData = {
      from: process.env.DEFAULT_EMAIL as string,
      to: [getToEmail(testEmailStatus)],
      subject: emailTemplate.emailSubject,
      react: body,
    };

    const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);
    const sendResponse = await resend.sendEmail(sendEmailRequest);
    log('sent email');
    statusCode = 201;

    ...
```

Resend provides several
[test email addresses](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/emails/send-test-emails)
(e.g. `bounced@resend.dev`) you can use to test sending emails, so we map the
`testEmailStatus` form data to a `to` email address via the `TestEmailStatus`
lookup. We then create a `SendEmailData` payload including `from`, `to`,
`subject`, and `body` information, and make a request to send the email via
`await resend.sendEmail`. Finally, we set a `statusCode` variable value of `201`
to indicate the resource has been created.

## How to index emails with Tigris Search

Before we continue with the `POST` handling code, let's look at how we define
our
[Search data model](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdkstools/typescript/database/datamodel/)
and create the search index.

First, we define an `Email` class:

```ts title=src/db/models/email.ts
export const EMAIL_INDEX_NAME = "emails";

@TigrisSearchIndex(EMAIL_INDEX_NAME)
export class Email implements EmailResult {
  @SearchField({ id: true })
  id?: string;

  @SearchField({ sort: true })
  firstTo!: string;

  @SearchField({ elements: TigrisDataTypes.STRING })
  to!: string[];

  @SearchField({ sort: true })
  from!: string;

  @SearchField({ sort: true })
  subject!: string;

  @SearchField()
  body!: string;

  @SearchField({ sort: true, facet: true })
  status!: EmailStatus;

  @SearchField({ sort: true })
  createdAt!: Date;
}
```

The `Email` class defines the Search document model to be created in an index
called `emails`. Fields to be indexed are marked with a `@SearchField`
decorator, if they are to be sortable, `sort` is set in the decorator, if they
are a potential `facet`, they are also marked as such. Where possible, data
types are inferred. Since `to` is an Array,
`{ elements: TigrisDataTypes.STRING }` must be passed to the decorator.

With the Search data model defined, we need to create the search index:

```ts title=scripts/setup.ts
import { Email } from "../src/db/models/email";
import { Tigris } from "@tigrisdata/core";

const main = async () => {
  const client = new Tigris();
  const search = client.getSearch();
  await search.createOrUpdateIndex<Email>(Email);
};

main();
```

This simple script should be run whenever the application starts, data model
code is changed, or the application is built. It informs Tigris of the Search
Model structure and instructs Tigris to create a search index via the async call
to `search.createOrUpdateIndex<Email>(Email)`.

Now that we've created the search index, we can head back to the `POST` handling
function.

With the email sent, we can create the email document in the search index.

```ts title=src/app/api/email/route.tsx
    const sendResponse = await resend.sendEmail(sendEmailRequest);
    log('sent email');
    statusCode = 201;

    const bodyString = reactElementToJSXString(body);
    log('created body string', bodyString);

    emailIndex: Email = {
      to: sendEmailRequest.to as string[],
      firstTo: sendEmailRequest.to[0] as string,
      from: sendEmailRequest.from,
      status: EmailStatus.Pending,
      subject: emailTemplate.emailSubject,
      body: bodyString,
      createdAt: new Date(),
      id: (sendResponse as EmailResponse).id,
    };

    log('creating index', emailIndex);
    // uses environment variables for credentials
    const tigris = new Tigris();
    const search = tigris.getSearch();
    const emails = await search.getIndex<Email>(EMAIL_INDEX_NAME);
    const createResult = await emails.createOne(emailIndex);

    if (createResult.error) {
      console.error('Error occurred saving search index', createResult.error);
    } else {
      log('Index created', createResult);
    }

    ...
```

The `emailIndex` variable is assigned a structure matching the `Email` class
data model we've defined. We then get the `emails` index using
`await search.getIndex<Email>(EMAIL_INDEX_NAME)` and then create the email
document within the index with `await emails.createOne(emailIndex)`. Finally, we
check the result and log success or failure

:::note

A `201` even if the index creation fails?

I made the decision to still return a `201` if the email is sent but the search
index insertion fails. This is an interesting point for discussion.

:::

With the email sent and the document inserted into the search index, we return
the email index to the client if everything has gone as expected. Otherwise, we
return a status code of 400 along with the error message.

```ts title=src/app/api/email/route.tsx
    if (createResult.error) {
      console.error('Error occurred saving search index', createResult.error);
    } else {
      log('Index created', createResult);
    }
  } catch (ex: any) {
    console.error(ex);
    return NextResponse.json({ error: ex.toString() }, { status: statusCode });
  }

  return NextResponse.json(emailIndex, { status: statusCode });
}
```

Here's what the sending experience looks like which makes use of the `POST`
endpoint:

import sendingEmail from "./sending-email.mp4";

<video controls style={{ width: "100%" }}>
  <source src={sendingEmail} />
</video>

## How to search with Tigris Search

The whole point of adding documents to the search index is to enable us to build
a search experience.

Let's walk through the `GET` search handler:

```ts title=src/app/api/email/route.tsx
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const response: SearchResponse = {
    results: [],
    meta: undefined,
    error: undefined,
  };

  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
  log('searchParams', searchParams);

  try {
    const query = searchParams.get('search') || undefined;
    const statuses = searchParams.get('statuses') || undefined;
    const sortOrder = toSortOrder(searchParams.get('sortdir'));

    // Number(null) = 0
    const page = Number(searchParams.get('page'));
    if (page <= 0) {
      throw new Error(
        '"page" is a required search parameter and must be a number greater than 0'
      );
    }

    ...
```

At the top of the `GET` function, we create a `response` to hold the query
result: a search result or an error. We also extract the `searchParam` from the
`request` and the following parameters:

- `query`: the textual query
- `statuses`: one or more of the valid email status values
- `sortdir`: this is sent as `asc` or `desc`. We convert the latter into a sort
  order with the structure `{ field: 'createdAt', order: '$desc' | '$asc' }` to
  be used with the Tigris SDK.
- `page`: used for search pagination. Required by this endpoint.

Next, we perform the search using the Tigris SDK:

```ts title=src/app/api/email/route.tsx
    const tigris = new Tigris();
    const search = tigris.getSearch();
    const emails = await search.getIndex<Email>(EMAIL_INDEX_NAME);

    const searchQuery: SearchQuery<Email> = {
      q: query,
      sort: sortOrder,
      hitsPerPage: PAGE_SIZE,
    };

    if (statuses) {
      const orFilter: Filter<Email>[] = statuses.split(',').map((status) => {
        const enumAsStr = status as unknown as EmailStatus;
        const asEnum = EmailStatus[enumAsStr];
        log('map', status, enumAsStr, asEnum);
        return {
          status: asEnum,
        } as Filter<Email>;
      });

      if (orFilter.length > 1) {
        searchQuery.filter = {
          $or: orFilter,
        };
      } else {
        searchQuery.filter = orFilter[0];
      }
    }

    log('searchQuery', JSON.stringify(searchQuery, null, 2));
    const tigris = new Tigris();
    const search = tigris.getSearch();
    const queryResult = await emails.search(searchQuery, page);
    log('queryResult', queryResult);

    ...
```

Above, we get the search index with
`await search.getIndex<Email>(EMAIL_INDEX_NAME)`, and build a
`SearchQuery<Email>` using `query`, the `sortOrder` (created via the `sortdir`
search parameter), and set a paging size (`PAGE_SIZE` is defined elsewhere but
can be any numerical value. In this app we use `10`.).

If `statuses` is populated it will be a comma-separated list of values (e.g.
`Delivered,Bounced`) so we split the string by `,`, and map the string values to
emums representing the `EmailStatus` values, and create a
[search filter](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdkstools/typescript/search/search/#filters)
on the `status` search document property. If there's only one `statuses` filter,
this is used standalone. If multiple `statuses` have been sent, we need to split
the query into multiple `$or` filters.

Finally, we execute the search with `await emails.search(searchQuery, page)`,
passing in the `SearchQuery<Email>` and `page` representing the desired page
used in search pagination.

We're now ready to build the JSON response:

```ts title=src/app/api/email/route.tsx
    response.results = queryResult.hits.map((hit) => hit.document);
    response.meta = queryResult.meta;
  } catch (ex) {
    console.error(ex);
    response.error = ex as string;
  }

  return NextResponse.json(response);
}
```

Once we have the search result, we `map` over the hits and create an Array of
`hit.document`, which are of type `Email` from our data model. We also pass the
`queryResult.meta` information to the client via `result.meta`. This contains
information such as the total number of search results, the current page, and
the page size.

With that, search functionality is in place.

  <source src={search} />

## How Resend webhooks trigger Tigris Search index updates

The final step is to handle inbound webhooks from Resend that indicate when the
status of an email has changed. For example, when it's `Delivered`, `Opened`, or
when a link in the email is `Clicked`.

```ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  let statusCode = 500;

  try {
    const body = (await request.json()) as ResendWebhook;
    log('WebHook', JSON.stringify(body, null, 2));
    const newStatus: EmailStatus = WebHookToEmailStatusLookup[body.type];
    log(`Updating status to`, newStatus);

    ...
```

The `POST` function starts by assuming the worst and setting the HTTP response
`statusCode` to `500`. It then gets the `json` payload sent from Resend and
asserts it as a type defined by `ResendWebhook`. We then perform a lookup to
determine the event type from the payload (`Delivered`, `Bounced` etc.).

Once we know the event type of Resend webhook, we want to retrieve the document
from the search index that relates to the email the webhook is for:

```ts
    log(`Updating status to`, newStatus);

    log('getting index and document');
    const emailsIndex = await search.getIndex<Email>(EMAIL_INDEX_NAME);
    const toUpdate = await emailsIndex.getOne(body.data.email_id);
    log('found document', JSON.stringify(toUpdate, null, 2));

    if (toUpdate === undefined) {
      statusCode = 404;
      throw new Error(
        `Could not find document in index for Email with id ${body.data.email_id}`
      );
    }

    ...
```

Here, we get the index and assign it to an `emailsIndex` variable. We then use
the `body.data.email_id` from the webhook to find the document to update with
`emailsIndex.getOne(body.data.email_id)`. If the document can't be found, we set
the `statusCode` to `404 and throw an `Error`.

If we've made it this far, we've found the document we want to update.

```ts
    if (toUpdate === undefined) {
      errorStatusCode = 404;
      throw new Error(
        `Could not find document in index for Email with id ${body.data.email_id}`
      );
    }

    toUpdate.document.status = newStatus;
    const updateStatus = await emailsIndex.updateOne(toUpdate.document);
    log('Update result', JSON.stringify(updateStatus, null, 2));

    if (updateStatus.error) {
      const msg = 'Error updating indexed document:' + updateStatus.error;
      console.error(msg);
      throw new Error(msg);
    }
    statusCode = 200;
  } catch (ex) {
    console.error(ex);
  }

  return NextResponse.json({}, { status: statusCode });
}
```

So, we update the `status` of the document with the new status from the webhook
and perform an update with `emailsIndex.updateOne(toUpdate.document)`. We then
check the status of the update, and if it was successful set the `statusCode` to
`200`. Finally, we send a response using
`NextResponse.json({}, { status: statusCode })` which make use of the
`statusCode` we've been setting throughout the `POST` function. A `200` tells
Resend that the webhook was successfully handled. Error response codes are
handled differently and may result in retries.
