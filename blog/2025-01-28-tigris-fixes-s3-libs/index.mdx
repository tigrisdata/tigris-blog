Recently Amazon
[made changes to the S3 libraries that broke Tigris support](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/downgrade-py-js/).
We have made fixes on our end and you can upgrade to the latest releases of the
AWS CLI, AWS SDK for Python (boto3), AWS SDK for JavaScript, AWS SDK for Java
and AWS SDK for PHP.

If you are running into any issues with these updated SDK releases, please reach
out via [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/tigrisdata.com),
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tigrisdata/?viewAsMember=true), or
