**Sunnyvale, CA - 23rd September 2022 -** Tigris Data, a groundbreaking open
source developer data platform provider, today announced the launch of its
serverless and open source developer data platform Tigris. Tigris is aimed at
web and mobile apps, providing a unified API that spans search, event streaming,
and transactional document store, along with smart features like automatic
indexing and management. By using serverless and a single API, this approach
simplifies the data infrastructure for application developers and enables them
to focus on building.

The company launched with seed funding of $6.9million, including backing from
[General Catalyst](https://www.generalcatalyst.com/) and
[Basis Set Ventures](https://www.basisset.com/) as well as a range of open
source and software leaders including
[Guillermo Rauch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillermo-rauch-b834b917b/) (CEO at Vercel) and
[Rob Skillington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robskillington/) (CTO and Co-Founder, Chronosphere).
In addition, [Peter Zaitsev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterzaitsev/), CEO at Percona,
is an Advisor for Tigris. Tigris Data also received funding from
[Netlify's Jamstack Innovation Fund](https://www.netlify.com/blog/jamstack-innovation-fund-launches-with-the-10-most-promising-jamstack-startups/),
which supports the most promising companies in the community.

The cost of maintaining multiple data services is not only expensive, but is
disruptive to development time. Tigris is an all-in-one open source developer
data platform with a single, unified API to ensure developers spend less time
on tedious infrastructure management and more time on what they do best - coding
and feature development. Tigris is based on FoundationDB, a distributed database
that was open sourced by Apple in 2018 under the Apache 2.0 licence. With
FoundationDB at its core, Tigris is designed to help developers to:

- Eliminate the need for deploying, configuring, securing, monitoring, and
  maintaining data infrastructure
- Prevent data silos and data infrastructure sprawl
- Stop the need for administration operations such as cluster management,
  query tuning, index optimization, and other maintenance activities
- Reduce the number of moving parts within applications that can cause outages
  and slowdowns
- Remove reliability and scalability issues as applications scale and need
  changes
- Avoid vendor lock-in and maintain control of their data

_"Developers want to build applications and scale up those services, and they
don't want to spend time managing databases or linking up infrastructure
components. They want to use an API like approach to interact with data,
in just the same way as they interact with other services. And they want to
achieve all this fast. This is why we built and launched Tigris,"_ commented
Ovais Tariq, CEO at Tigris Data. _"Providing that single approach to data
management in one developer-friendly environment makes it easier to prevent
data infrastructure sprawl and let the developers focus on what they like
best - building - while still providing all the services that developers need.
Lastly, building this as an open source platform means that developers can
avoid lock-in."_

As a company, Tigris Data was founded by senior engineers,
[Ovais Tariq](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ovaistariq/),
[Himank Chaudhary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/himank-chaudhary-1937b958/) and
[Yevgeniy Firsov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/efirsov/), that led the
development of data storage and management at Uber, where they faced exactly
the same challenges around data growth and infrastructure sprawl. Before this,
the team worked across various data and infrastructure teams including time at
Yahoo, SanDisk, Percona and Khoros. With this experience, the team was inspired
with the idea of creating a developer data platform to simplify data
applications without sacrificing speed or scalability.

_"Ovais and the whole team at Tigris are super focused on customer value -
building a true platform solution that scales with the developer,"_ said
[Quentin Clark](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quentin-clark/), managing director
at General Catalyst. _"Out in the industry, we are seeing innovation towards
eliminating the depth of 'infrastructure' expertise that was once necessary to
build to scale. Tigris is exactly this."_

_"Developers increasingly make the decisions that set their applications –
and their companies – on the route to success. Being the developer data
platform of choice for developers is a huge market that existing companies
have not fully solved, so there is a great opportunity for new entrants to
win here. We are pleased to support the Tigris Data team in their approach,"_
added [Xuezhao Lan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xuezhao-lan-lan-50aa1a1/),
Founder and Managing Partner, Basis Set Ventures.

_"The open source market continues to innovate and find solutions to the
problems that developers and data professionals face. Simplifying the
interactions around data using API interface fits with how developers want
to build and implement their applications in the cloud. I'm happy to support
Ovais and his team in building Tigris as they start their journey,"_ commented
[Peter Zaitsev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterzaitsev/), advisor to
Tigris Data and CEO at open source database company Percona.
