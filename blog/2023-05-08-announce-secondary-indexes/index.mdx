title: "Global secondary indexes are now available"
description: >
  This blog post shows how to model NoSQL many-to-many relations using embeded
  documents and referencing another collection in a NoSQL database. It shows how
  to use Tigris's transactions to make updates across collections consistent.
  And recommends when to use either NoSQL design pattern. It also shows how to
  use full-text Search for advanced queries.

Global Secondary indexes have been added to the Tigris opensource NoSQL database and is available on Tigris Cloud.
Secondary indexes allow for fast and efficient querying of documents in a database's collection. Tigris now supports
both full-text search and secondary indexes allowing for comprehensive and very efficient querying of your data.

## Getting started

To add a secondary index to a field, update the collections schema and add a `index:true` to the field that you want indexed:

```typescript
@TigrisCollection("catalog")
export class Catalog {
  @PrimaryKey({ order: 1, autogenerate: true })
  id?: number;

  @Field()
  name: string;

  @Field({ index: true })
  price: number;

  @Field()
  brand: string;
}

const tigrisClient = new Tigris();
// ensure branch exists, create it if it needs to be created dynamically
await tigrisClient.getDatabase().initializeBranch();
// register schemas
await tigrisClient.registerSchemas([Catalog]);
```

If the collection is a new collection the indexes will be immediately ready to be used, if it is an existing index,
then log into the Tigris Cloud Web Console to update the collection and build the secondary indexes.

Tigris will choose the best secondary index to serve queries against a collection.

```typescript
const cursor = await users.findMany({ filter: { price: { $gt: 100 } } });
```
