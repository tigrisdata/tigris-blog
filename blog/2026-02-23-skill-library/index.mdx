When you are automating things, the dream is to be able to _offload_ the task to
the automation so you don't have to do it by hand anymore. At Tigris we're
excited about [agent skills](https://agentskills.io/home) because they let us
describe how to do things in simple human-friendly language and then put that
documentation to work with AI agents. We suspect that this will also make
spinning up new teammates easier as they join our team.

If you want to check out our agent skills library, take a look on
[skills.sh](http://skills.sh):

## Agent skills are cool as heck

I'm gonna admit, when I first heard of agent skills, I thought they were
superfluous and a waste of time. I'm kind of inherently a
[cynic](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_(philosophy)>) when it comes to
AI tools as I tend to prefer minimalism when possible. Adding skills around
seemed like a waste of time because I wasn't convinced that it would actually
make things better.

After using them for a while, I think I've found the right niche that they fit
into. Agent skills are halfway between high level documentation for humans and
low level scripts to automate tasks. They best fit into those shapes of problems
that you can _describe_ and _validate_ easily, but would take a lot of annoying
or fiddly code to implement properly.

### The shape where skills are needed

As an example of the right shape of problem, consider the problem of image
format optimization. In our documentation and blog repositories we ban using png
files for images that get included into pages. We store all our documentation,
blogposts, and static assets in a git repository and git
[is notoriously bad at handling large files properly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29393447/why-cant-git-handle-large-files-and-large-repos).
As a result we end up converting image files to webp with `ffmpeg`:

```
ffmpeg -i image.png image.webp
```

This can make images go from filling entire 3d-printed save icons to 50,000
kilobytes. If the images are smaller, they'll load faster and you can enjoy what
we write more easily.

At first I thought this was the right shape of problem for a script. If you
think about it, the core elements are there:

- Clearly defined problem with obvious solutions (convert images, replace
  references, delete old files).
- Trivially verifiable output (no png files, images load properly in the
  websites).
- Easy to use APIs for parsing and converting the relevant files.

However this doesn't really pan out in practice. There are many ways to include
an image in a markdown file and adding edge cases for all of them tends to get
annoying fast, especially when using multi-line HTML tags like our formatter
does.

As a result, I made the
[convert image to webp skill](https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigris-blog/blob/main/.claude/skills/convert-images-to-webp/SKILL.md)
in our blog repo. This automates the entire process and creates trivial to
review patches. This makes copying blogposts over from Google Docs into our blog
repo take single digit minutes instead of upwards of an hour at the worst case.

## Our skill library

As I was experimenting with other skills and making my own, I realized that we
needed to share them so that everyone else can benefit from the best of the
best. As a result, we now have the
[Tigris Agent Skills Library](https://skills.sh/tigrisdata/skills) and you can
install the skills with `npx skills add`:

```
npx skills add https://github.com/tigrisdata/skills
```

### Tigris SDK skills

The following skills help your agents use the
[Tigris SDK](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdks/tigris/) better:

- [Installing Tigris Storage](https://skills.sh/tigrisdata/skills/installing-tigris-storage):
  Installing and setting up the Tigris SDK.
- [Tigris Object Operations](https://skills.sh/tigrisdata/skills/tigris-object-operations):
  How to do basic object operations in TypeScript.
- [Tigris Bucket Management](https://skills.sh/tigrisdata/skills/tigris-bucket-management):
  How to create, list, inspect, and remove buckets in Tigris.
- [Tigris Snapshots and Forking](https://skills.sh/tigrisdata/skills/tigris-snapshots-forking):
  How to snapshot and fork buckets in Tigris.

These skills help agents a lot because the Tigris SDK is intended to be very
intuitive and AI agents don't always have language server integrations. This
restates parts of the documentation in authoritative text that AI agents can
easily understand, hook into, and use to help guide you through taking advantage
of everything that Tigris has to offer. They're also fully suitable for humans
to learn from, if a bit dry.

### Conventional Commits

Tigris uses
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) so that
we can easily glance at commits and pull requests to get a rough idea of what
they do. If AI models are prompted to write conventional commits in your
[AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) file, they'll usually get it somewhat right, but
we can do better.

The
[conventional-commits](https://skills.sh/tigrisdata/skills/conventional-commits)
skill makes AI models get it right _every_ time. Even better, the description is
filled with the right keywords to make agents latch onto the skills whenever you
ask to commit something:

```
name: conventional-commits
description: >
  Use when creating git commits, writing commit messages,
  or following version control workflows.
```

This results in commits that look like this:

```
chore: format code with prettier

Run npx prettier -w to format code.

Assisted-by: GLM 4.7 via Claude Code
Signed-off-by: Xe Iaso <xe@tigrisdata.com>
```

This is much better than the worst I've seen on some teams where you get
multi-thousand line commits with messages like "implemented metrics rollups".

You can install just the conventional commits skill with this command:

```
npx skills add https://github.com/tigrisdata/skills --skill conventional-commits
```

### Go table-driven tests

When writing tests in [Go](https://go.dev), the idiomatic style is to use a
[table-driven test](https://go.dev/wiki/TableDrivenTests) where you define a
table of inputs and expected outputs. This allows you to easily add test cases
without having to copy and paste your environment setup and teardown code every
time. Every test gets run as its own subtest so you can see each test's result
at a glance.

The table-driven tests skill teaches agents how to best implement table-driven
tests based on advice from the greatest minds in Go programming. In my
experience this has made tests that are performant, correct, and easy to debug.

You can install just the table-driven tests skill with this command:

```
npx skills add https://github.com/tigrisdata/skills --skill go-table-driven-tests
```

## Other cool things we're doing with skills

We've been messing around with Claude Code skills for other things internally on
my team at Tigris.

When I write something I usually use a chorus of four style guides to do a
once-over to find glaring issues:

- A style guide based on [the patterns of my blog](https://xeiaso.net/blog),
  this pass mostly focuses on things that speak _up_ to the reader and avoiding
  overly corporate phrasing.
- [SEO & AEO Best Practices](https://skills.sh/sanity-io/agent-toolkit/seo-aeo-best-practices)
  to make sure that my writing has active voice (being moderately femme of
  centre makes me more likely to speak in passive voice) and is well understood
  by search/answer engines.
- [Humanizer](https://skills.sh/softaworks/agent-toolkit/humanizer) because I am
  exposed to a lot of AI writing due to my job function. I've kinda adopted some
  of the AI writing patterns without realizing it and having something call it
  out helps me not repeat that framing.
- [Writing Clearly and Concisely](https://skills.sh/obra/the-elements-of-style/writing-clearly-and-concisely),
  the eternally relevant style guide by Strunk & White for writing clearly and
  cutting fluff ruthlessly.

This has some interesting side effects, notably AI models will tell me how much
"myself" my writing is. Having a robot tell you that you need to write more like
yourself is so excessively cyberpunk that I don't even know where to begin to
explain it. It really does help when you're going through some mild medical
stress like I am right now though.

I've also made a skill
[to help organize notes and brain dumps into deep dive posts](https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigris-blog/blob/main/.claude/skills/build-with-me-outline/SKILL.md).
Maybe this will be useful, I have to do more experimentation to know for sure.

## Supercharge your agents with skills

Agent skills won't solve every problem, but for that middle ground of
"describable, verifiable, annoying to code" they're incredibly powerful. They've
already saved us hours on image optimization and commit hygiene. As we discover
more use cases, we'll add them to the library. Please be sure to keep an eye out
for them! We'll post on [our Discord](https://community.tigrisdata.com/) as we
discover and mint good ones.

If working on things like this sounds neat to you,
[we're hiring](https://www.tigrisdata.com/careers/). You'll get to work
alongside me as we reinvent the future of how people interact with object
storage.

Otherwise, go out and use Tigris to change the world via B2B Saas!
