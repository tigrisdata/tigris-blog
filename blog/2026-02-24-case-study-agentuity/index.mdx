**TL;DR**

- Agentuity is a full-stack platform for building and deploying AI agents, built
  on custom infrastructure designed from the ground up for agentic workloads.
- Agentuity's architecture handles the unpredictable, stateful, and ephemeral
  nature of agent compute. Agents can run for hours, snapshot themselves, and
  fork from prior sessions.
- Tigris powers five storage layers across Agentuity's platform: agent
  persistent storage, deployment assets, CDN, customer buckets, and sandbox
  snapshots.
- Agents get a native filesystem interface backed by Tigris via TigrisFS.
  Unlimited storage that looks like files on disk but scales globally.

Roads existed before cars. But once cars showed up, the roads had to change.
That's the argument [Agentuity](https://agentuity.com/) is making about cloud
infrastructure: the architecture that powered two decades of web applications
wasn't built for a world where billions of AI agents spin up, do work, snapshot
themselves, and disappear.

Agentuity is a full-stack platform for building and deploying AI agents.
Developers get SDKs for storage, key-value, and durable queues. Agents get
sandboxed runtimes with fine-grained control over networking, storage, and
compute. The whole thing runs on Agentuity's custom orchestration layer, not
Kubernetes, and it can deploy across multiple clouds or bare metal.

## Why agents need a different cloud

Traditional cloud infrastructure assumes predictable workloads. You know roughly
what a web server needs. You can size your instances, pre-provision your disks,
and plan your traffic patterns. Agent workloads break all of those assumptions.

  Agent workloads are fundamentally different. Every request could be
  dramatically different from the last. We're used to typical traffic patterns,
  but agentic workloads are nothing like a regular API server. We needed to be
  able to move things around and scale differently. That needed to be rethought.
</BreakoutQuote>

Agents are stateful. They write files constantly. Filesystem is a native
primitive for them. They might pull down massive datasets or reuse data from
previous sessions. A sandbox might run for four hours or four seconds. You can't
pre-provision for workloads when you don't know what you're going to need until
the agent starts working.

Agentuity went low. They're not on Kubernetes. They built their own
orchestration layer, what they call the gravity network, running containerd with
a control plane called Pilot wrapping each container. They own the runtime down
to the system call level using eBPF, giving them visibility into every network
and system call an agent makes. That control means they can lock things down,
cache aggressively, and move workloads around their fleet.

## The architecture

Agentuity runs two types of compute that share the same runtime but serve
different patterns. Long-running agents behave more like traditional VMs,
listening for requests, idling with fast cold starts and warm starts. Sandboxes
are ephemeral: one agent can spawn ten sub-agents, creating a graph of compute
nodes that execute and disappear. Claude Code launching parallel sub-agents is a
good mental model. Each one is a separate sandbox with its own isolated
environment.

Sandboxes come with aggressive lifecycle management. Agentuity suspends
workloads after idle time and delivers fast cold starts. Agents opt into
everything: network, storage, compute resources. Runtime images are defined by
the developer, and the platform controls exactly how containers spin up and
down.

  We think the future is agentic software. There's going to be billions of these
  agentic apps everywhere, and the world needs a different approach to
  infrastructure. Web architecture has been great, but a lot of it isn't
  relevant anymore. We're building the cloud of tomorrow.
</BreakoutQuote>

Agents get serverless without the time limits. An agent can run for hours, but
the developer experience stays simple. The platform handles secrets management,
billing, ephemeral keys, and notifications. Developers or agents can create new
projects from scratch or add agent capabilities into existing applications, what
Agentuity calls "full-stack agents" that work in both greenfield and brownfield
scenarios.

## Five layers of Tigris

Agentuity uses [Tigris](https://www.tigrisdata.com/), a globally distributed,
multi-cloud object storage service with S3 compatibility, in five ways across
their platform.

<AgentuityStorageDiagram />

### Agent persistent storage

The S3-compatible interface lets Agentuity treat Tigris as permanent storage for
agents. Storage gets attached to an agent on the fly, and as agents write files,
data flows through to Tigris. Agents see files on disk. The platform stores them
as globally distributed objects.

  Having an S3-compatible storage layer allowed us to treat it as agent
  permanent storage. We attach storage to an agent on the fly. As they write, it
  gets written to Tigris. To customers, it's just files on disk. From an agent
  workloads standpoint, we wanted to assign virtually unlimited storage.
  Depending on the task, the agent might need to pull down a lot of data or
  reuse data from a previous session.
</BreakoutQuote>

Agents access this through TigrisFS, a mounted `/data` folder backed by a Tigris
bucket. It looks and acts like a POSIX filesystem, but it's object storage
underneath. Customers use this to share large models across their compute
infrastructure, and agents use it for the constant stream of small files they
generate during work.

### Deployment assets

When a developer deploys an agent, the deployment artifacts are encrypted with
their public key and stored in Tigris. For on-premises deployments, only the
customer can decrypt the assets. One-time signed URLs handle the upload from the
customer's machine directly into the infrastructure, with no intermediate
storage needed.

### Global CDN

Agentuity uses Tigris as the origin behind their CDN, with Tigris acting as a
pull-through cache for globally distributed deployment assets. Customers see
Agentuity-branded URLs, but the backing storage is Tigris, globally replicated
and ready at the edge.

### On-demand customer buckets

Developers can create storage buckets on demand. Push-button, unlimited storage.
Agentuity manages secrets injection, ephemeral keys, billing, and notifications.
Buckets can be partitioned or shared across projects. Agents can provision
storage for themselves without human intervention.

### Sandbox snapshots

  The problem with sandboxing is you don't know what you need. In a traditional
  workload, you know generally what you need and can pre-provision. With agents,
  you don't. Agents love writing files. Filesystem is a native primitive for
  them. Storage needs to be highly dynamic and fast. You can't wait minutes to
  restore things.
</BreakoutQuote>

When a sandbox goes idle, its full state, CPU registers, memory, and storage,
gets captured and stored as a real artifact in a Tigris bucket. These snapshots
are mounted across Agentuity's fleet of machines, so when spinning up a new
machine, the data is already available locally. Changes are indexed with a
timeline tied to the sandbox ID, making it possible to roll back to any point
and fork from a prior session.

## Built for what's next

Agentuity evaluated dedicated database solutions and other storage providers. S3
as a protocol interface opened up capabilities that more specialized tools
couldn't match. Tigris works as a filesystem, a CDN origin, a snapshot store,
and an agent's personal storage. All through one interface.

  Tigris worked really well with agents. An agent can connect to storage, spin
  it up, use it, tear it down. Agents don't want heavyweight infrastructure that
  lives forever. They want primitives they can spin up, use, and discard as part
  of their work. That's what we got.
</BreakoutQuote>

Agentuity already runs agents on its own infrastructure, watching logs and
surfacing issues to other agents. The "get started" guide on their blog is a
prompt: an agent deploys your first agent. The storage layer has to be just as
dynamic as the compute, and that's what Tigris provides.
