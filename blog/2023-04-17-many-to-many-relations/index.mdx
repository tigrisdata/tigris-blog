This is part 3 of the
[NoSQL Data Modeling Series](/blog/tags/nosql-data-modeling-series/). In part
one of the series, we covered
[modeling NoSQL one-to-one relations](../2023-03-02-one-to-one-relations/index.mdx).
and in part two we explored
[modeling NoSQL one-to-many relations](../2023-03-09-one-to-many-relations/index.mdx).
This is the third and final post and we will dive into **modeling NoSQL
many-to-many relations**.

We model NoSQL many-to-many relations in two ways:

1. [Embeded many-to-many NoSQL data modeling](/blog/nosql-modeling-many-to-many-relations-with-search/#embeded)
2. [Many-to-many NoSQL data modeling using a joining collection](/blog/nosql-modeling-many-to-many-relations-with-search/#joining)

For the second example we'll use related documents and demonstrate full-text
search to perform advanced queries against our data.

## Getting started

The principles outlined here are applicable to any NoSQL database. However, to
follow along, you will need to get set up with Tigris. This is a quick and easy
process. The Tigris Docs have a
[Quickstart](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/quickstarts/) to show you how to
sign up.

Once you have signed up, create a new project called **relations** and then
create a new local application from a Tigris template to get started:

```sh
$ npx create-tigris-app@latest --project relations --example playground
```

Follow the prompts to add your `clientId` and `clientSecret`.

## Embeded many-to-many NoSQL data modeling {#embeded}

Let us start with modeling NoSQL many-to-many relations with an embeded
document. To do that we will model a set of courses and students. There will be
many courses with many students in each.

In the playground repository create a new file in the model directory -
`src/db/models/courses.ts`. In that file create a `course` and `student`
collection that will look like the below:

```ts showLineNumbers {29,33} title="src/db/models/courses.ts"
import {
  Field,
  PrimaryKey,
  SearchField,
  TigrisCollection,
  TigrisDataTypes,
} from "@tigrisdata/core";

@TigrisCollection("course")
export class Course {
  @PrimaryKey(TigrisDataTypes.INT64, { order: 1, autoGenerate: false })
  id?: number;

  @Field()
  title: string;

  @Field()
  description: string;
}

@TigrisCollection("student")
export class Student {
  @PrimaryKey(TigrisDataTypes.STRING, { order: 1, autoGenerate: false })
  email: string;

  @Field()
  name: string;

  @SearchField(TigrisDataTypes.ARRAY, { elements: TigrisDataTypes.INT64 })
  @Field(TigrisDataTypes.ARRAY, { elements: TigrisDataTypes.INT64 })
  courseIds: Array<number>;

  @Field(TigrisDataTypes.ARRAY, { elements: TigrisDataTypes.STRING })
  interests: Array<string>;
}
```

We have created two models, each in its own collection. The first collection,
`course`, will contains all the courses a student can take. The second
collection is the `student` collection and will contain a list of students, we
will also embed the courses the student is attending in the student document. On
line `29` and `33` we also add a search tag to the `courseIds` and the
`interests` array. This will allow us to use Tigris' full-text Search to query
for specific courses.

Now let's change the `index.ts` file so that we can explore this NoSQL design
pattern:

```ts showLineNumbers{5-13,19,71-73} title="src/index.ts"
import { Tigris } from "@tigrisdata/core";
import { Student, Course } from "./db/models/courses";

// setup client
const tigrisClient = new Tigris();
async function setup() {
  // ensure branch exists, create it if it needs to be created dynamically
  const db = await tigrisClient.getDatabase();
  await db.initializeBranch();
  await db.dropAllCollections();
  // register schemas
  await tigrisClient.registerSchemas([Student, Course]);
}

async function main() {
  await setup();
  const db = await tigrisClient.getDatabase();
  const courseCollection = await db.getCollection<Course>(Course);
  const studentCollection = await db.getCollection<Student>(Student);

  const tx = await db.beginTransaction();
  await courseCollection.insertOrReplaceMany([
    {
      id: 1,
      title:
        "I tried these 10 things with a databases and you won't guess what happened next",
      description: "Learn all about the basics of database systems",
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: "Next.js to the MAX!!!",
      description:
        "Take your Next.js development to the maximum with this course....",
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      title: "Kubernetes is awesome",
      description: "Dispite many misgivings, K8 is awesome. Find out why",
    },
  ]);

  await studentCollection.insertOrReplaceMany([
    {
      email: "dolores@example.com",
      name: "Dolores Abernathy",
      courseIds: [1, 3],
      interests: ["kubernetes", "databases"],
    },
    {
      email: "maeve@example.com",
      name: "Maeve Millay",
      courseIds: [2, 3],
      interests: ["nextjs", "databases"],
    },
    {
      email: "charlotte@example.com",
      name: "Charlotte Hale",
      courseIds: [1, 2, 3],
      interests: ["nextjs"],
    },
    {
      email: "caleb@example.com",
      name: "Caleb Nichols",
      courseIds: [],
      interests: ["movies", "kubernetes", "databases"],
    },
  ]);

  await tx.commit();

  const iterator = await studentCollection.search({
    filter: { courseIds: 1, interests: "databases" },
  });

  for await (const resultPage of iterator) {
    for (const student of resultPage.hits) {
      console.log(student.document.name);
    }
  }
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    console.log("Complete ...");
    process.exit(0);
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

Lines `5` to `13` we set up our database and collections. On line 19 we start a
transaction and add documents to our collection in that transaction. This makes
sure that the data is consistent across both collections. On line `71` we use
Tigris' full-text search to find all students that are taking the first course
and have an interest in `"databases"`. Full-text Search is a great use case for
handling complex situations. I encourage you at this point to experiment with
some more complex queries to really see how well full-text Search will work.

Run `src/index.ts` as follows:

```sh
$ npx ts-node ./src/index.ts
```

And you'll see the following output:

```sh
info - Using reflection to infer type of Course#title
info - Using reflection to infer type of Course#description
info - Using reflection to infer type of Student#name
info - Using Tigris at: api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud:443
info - Using database branch: 'main'
event - Creating collection: 'student' in project: 'relations'
event - Creating collection: 'course' in project: 'relations'

:::note

I've used the `insertOrReplaceMany` because this is a sort demo and we want to
run it many times. But in production, typically you would choose `insertMany`.

## Many-to-many NoSQL data modeling using a joining collection {#joining}

The embedded approach to NoSQL many-to-many data modeling using the id's of the
related document works very well and will work in most use cases. And I would
recommend starting with this design. But there are cases when there are lots of
writes to update a document concurrently. This could lead to lots of write
conflicts. A way to avoid this is to create an intermediate document and
collection that links a student to a course. Let's do this by editing our
`courses.ts` file to look like this:

```ts showLineNumbers{34-41} title="src/db/models/courses.ts"
import {
  Field,
  PrimaryKey,
  SearchField,
  TigrisCollection,
  TigrisDataTypes,
} from "@tigrisdata/core";

@TigrisCollection("course")
export class Course {
  @PrimaryKey(TigrisDataTypes.INT64, { order: 1, autoGenerate: true })
  id?: number;

  @Field()
  title: string;

  @Field()
  description: string;
}

@TigrisCollection("student")
export class Student {
  @PrimaryKey(TigrisDataTypes.STRING, { order: 1, autoGenerate: false })
  email: string;

  @Field()
  name: string;

  @SearchField(TigrisDataTypes.ARRAY, { elements: TigrisDataTypes.STRING })
  @Field(TigrisDataTypes.ARRAY, { elements: TigrisDataTypes.STRING })
  interests: Array<string>;
}

@TigrisCollection("studentToCourse")
export class StudentToCourse {
  @PrimaryKey(TigrisDataTypes.STRING, { order: 1, autoGenerate: false })
  studentEmail: string;

  @PrimaryKey(TigrisDataTypes.INT64, { order: 2, autoGenerate: false })
  courseId: number;
}
```

We have removed `courseIds` from the `Student` model and instead created the
linking collection `StudentToCourse`. Notice that the primary key for
`StudentToCourse` is a combination of the `student` email address and the
`course` id. This forces a unique constraint so that a `student` will only be
signed up for a course once.

Let's add data and explore this model. Change your `index.ts` to look like this:

```ts showLineNumbers{24,70,91} title="src/index.ts"
import { Tigris } from "@tigrisdata/core";
import { Student, Course, StudentToCourse } from "./db/models/courses";

// setup client
const tigrisClient = new Tigris();
async function setup() {
  // ensure branch exists, create it if it needs to be created dynamically
  const db = await tigrisClient.getDatabase();
  db.initializeBranch();
  await db.dropAllCollections();
  // register schemas
  await tigrisClient.registerSchemas([Student, Course, StudentToCourse]);
}

async function main() {
  await setup();
  const db = await tigrisClient.getDatabase();
  const courseCollection = await db.getCollection<Course>(Course);
  const studentCollection = await db.getCollection<Student>(Student);
  const studentToCourseCollection = await db.getCollection<StudentToCourse>(
    StudentToCourse
  );

  let tx = await db.beginTransaction();
  await courseCollection.insertOrReplaceMany([
    {
      id: 1,
      title:
        "I tried these 10 things with a databases and you won't guess what happened next",
      description: "Learn all about the basics of database systems",
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: "Next.js to the MAX!!!",
      description:
        "Take your Next.js development to the maximum with this course....",
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      title: "Kubernetes is awesome",
      description: "Dispite many misgivings, K8 is awesome. Find out why",
    },
  ]);

  await studentCollection.insertOrReplaceMany([
    {
      email: "dolores@example.com",
      name: "Dolores Abernathy",
      interests: ["kubernetes", "databases"],
    },
    {
      email: "maeve@example.com",
      name: "Maeve Millay",
      interests: ["nextjs", "databases"],
    },
    {
      email: "charlotte@example.com",
      name: "Charlotte Hale",
      interests: ["nextjs"],
    },
    {
      email: "caleb@example.com",
      name: "Caleb Nichols",
      interests: ["movies", "kubernetes", "databases"],
    },
  ]);

  await tx.commit();

  tx = await db.beginTransaction();
  studentToCourseCollection.insertOrReplaceMany([
    {
      courseId: 1,
      studentEmail: "dolores@example.com",
    },
    {
      courseId: 3,
      studentEmail: "dolores@example.com",
    },
    {
      courseId: 2,
      studentEmail: "charlotte@example.com",
    },
    {
      courseId: 3,
      studentEmail: "charlotte@example.com",
    },
  ]);
  await tx.commit();

  tx = await db.beginTransaction();
  const iter = await studentToCourseCollection.findMany({
    filter: { courseId: 3 },
  });

  for await (const linkDoc of iter) {
    const student = await studentCollection.findOne({
      filter: { email: linkDoc.studentEmail },
    });
    console.log(student.name);
    const iter2 = studentToCourseCollection.findMany({
      filter: { studentEmail: student.email },
    });

    for await (const courseLink of iter2) {
      const course = await courseCollection.findOne({
        filter: { id: courseLink.courseId },
      });
      console.log(`course: ${course.title}`);
    }
  }

  await tx.commit();
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    console.log("Complete ...");
    process.exit(0);
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

On line `24` we create a transaction and add the students and courses. But there
is no association yet between `students` and `courses`. We then create another
transaction, on line `70`. We have added this in a different transaction to
simulate what would happen when a student would sign up for a course via a
website. Finally on line `91`, we do a query. We look for all the students
taking the course with id `3` and then we query for what other courses they are
doing and print all their courses to the console.

Run the example with:

```sh
npx ts-node ./src/index.ts
```

And you'll see the following output:

```sh
info - Using reflection to infer type of Course#title
info - Using reflection to infer type of Course#description
info - Using reflection to infer type of Student#name
info - Using Tigris at: api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud:443
info - Using database branch: 'main'
event - Creating collection: 'student' in project: 'relations'
event - Creating collection: 'course' in project: 'relations'
event - Creating collection: 'studentToCourse' in project: 'relations'
Charlotte Hale
course: Kubernetes is awesome
course: Next.js to the MAX!!!
Dolores Abernathy
course: Kubernetes is awesome
course: I tried these 10 things with a databases and you won't guess what happened next
Complete ...
```

Play around with the querying options to find students and courses in different
ways. One idea would be to search for a specific interest and then see which
courses those students are taking.

This completes the
[NoSQL data modeling series](/blog/tags/nosql-data-modeling-series/). This
series covered the three main ways to model relationships. How to model each one
in a few different ways to fit your needs and most importantly how to do that
safely with transactions.

## Next Steps
