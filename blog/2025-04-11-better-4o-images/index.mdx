I see a lot of AI generated illustrations these days and many of them have
_obvious_ and _glaring_ problems that make them look cheap and lazy. You should
really hire an artist to draw things for you; but if you’re dead set on using AI
generated illustrations, here’s how you can level up your skills and put those
images trapped in your head on the canvas in ways that will pop.

This kinda turned into a stream of consciousness art and composition 101 lesson.
Hope you enjoy that\!

## Vibe evaluation and planning

As much as people would love to imagine otherwise, a lot of art really is just
starting out with a rough product and feeling out the vibes as you work at it. A
lot of the core of this starts out with a single idea that you just continue to
flesh out and give form. Let’s take a look at the cover image for this post as
an example:

This is a synthesis of a few things:

- Ty the Tiger, one of the characters we’ve been working on in order to add
  flavor to the blog. I’m not sure what DND class he would play yet, but let’s
  just say bard because it would be amusing.
- My Final Fantasy 14 character W’zamqo Rhid, complete with her staff.
- A katana-wielding Xe to round the party out. Maybe Xe would be the
  [Dunban](https://youtu.be/rA73i-FGw08) of the party. Every RPG party needs a
  good old-fashioned evasion tank\!
- The Final Fantasy 7 battle UI in order to give it some kind of “grounding”, or
  some reason for all of those characters to be in the same place at the same
  time. Imagine as if it’s a rambunctious RPG party trying to save the world
  from bad art or something along those lines.

For the sake of argument, let’s say we’re using GPT-4o via the ChatGPT UI. Most
of my experience comes from making ornate flows with ComfyUI, but I’ll use this
model so you can follow along at home. Normally the process isn’t quite so
conversational, but maybe this’ll help you understand what I think about when I
make the cover images for this blog.

I like to start out with answering two questions in a fair bit of detail before
I generate anything:

1. What is there?
2. What is it like?

This is based on one of my favourite sources of inspiration for art: some
anonymous eBook I found about chaos magick, astral projection, and all of those
other fun things that you can only really find on the dark web. By focusing on
what is there and what it’s like, you can naturally flesh out _all of the
essential parts_ of an image by working backwards from the vibes.

For this, I want it to feel like a PS1 screenshot of an RPG battle, but a bit
surreal because it’s taking place in Seattle, like some kind of Stargate SG1
inspired fantasy RPG. So as for what is there:

- A forest with mountains in the distance, the detail doesn’t matter too much
  because they’re just adding to the flavour of the image, not the substance.
- The Space Needle peeking out as if it’s some massive landpoint that the party
  is working their way up to, like the final area in a multi-hundred story of
  courage, friendship, and succeeding against the odds.
- A somewhat balanced party layout with a DPS, a healer, and a tank.

And for what it is like:

- Focused, but still
- Balanced, yet tense
- Something that you could take a glance at and say “yeah that’s an RPG
  screenshot”.

You get the vibe, something cozy, like what you played on the CRT after midnight
even though you promised your parents you’d go to sleep early.

## Base layout

When doing art, you need reference images for the characters, scene, and other
important details. These help get across the vibe in "concrete" terms. Here’s
the reference images I used for this image:

export const imageFor = (name) =>
  `/blog/img/blog/better-4o-images/img/${name}.webp`;
export const thumbFor = (name) =>
  `/blog/img/blog/better-4o-images/thumbs/${name}.webp`;
export const mkImage = ({ name, title, alt, height, width }) => {
  return {
    original: imageFor(name),
    thumbnail: thumbFor(name),
    width,
    height,
    alt,
    title,
  };
};
