Tigris is a Serverless NoSQL Database and Search Platform that offers a modern
open source alternative to MongoDB and DynamoDB. Tigris utilizes FoundationDB's
transactional key-value interface as its underlying storage engine. In a blog
post titled
[How We Built the Data Layer on FoundationDB](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/data-layer-foundationdb/),
we delved into why we decided to use FoundationDB for this purpose. This blog
focuses on the serializable transactions provided by Tigris and compares it to
transactions in MongoDB.

Serializable transactions are a transactional consistency model that guarantees
that the outcome of concurrent transactions is equivalent to a serial execution
of these transactions. In other words, transactions executed concurrently under
serializable consistency appear to be executed one at a time in some sequential
order. This provides a strong guarantee for correctness, ensuring that the
execution of transactions doesn't create anomalous behaviors, such as dirty
reads or lost updates, which can occur in weaker isolation levels. FoundationDB,
used by Apple, Snowflake, and others, is such a system. It provides the same
consistency and isolation guarantees as Spanner - strict serializability and has
a fantastic correctness story through
[simulation testing](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/testing.html).

## Serializable Transactions in Tigris

Tigris employs FoundationDB's transactional key-value interface as its
underlying storage engine to provide multi document acid transactions.
Transactions can be initiated by users or by Tigris automatically upon receiving
a request, as they are core to every operation.

![Transactions](./transactions.jpg)

Tigris executes all operations within the context of a transaction by default,
enabling atomicity for all operations and allowing the application to perform
strongly consistent reads after writing to the database. However, specific use
cases necessitate transactions across multiple collections or documents. To
accommodate these cases, Tigris provides interactive transaction functionality
that allows users to easily perform multi document transactions with ACID
properties. Tigris leverages FoundationDB's concurrency control to support these
features. In the following section, we will review how transactions work inside
Tigris.

### Transaction Coordinator

A Tigris deployment consists of multiple workers that receive and process the
queries. Upon receiving a query, one of the Tigris servers acts as a request
coordinator. The coordinator assesses whether the request can be handled locally
or must be forwarded to the transaction owner using the information available in
the transactional context. By reading this context, the coordinator can
determine if the request is new, an interactive, transactional request that can
be handled locally, or an interactive, transactional request that should be
forwarded to its owner.

### Managing Transaction Sessions

The session manager in Tigris is responsible for managing transaction sessions,
which are created each time a new transaction request is made. The session
manager attaches a transactional context to each session and tracks all sessions
created by the server using a session tracker. A session object is responsible
for managing the lifecycle of a transaction. Each session utilizes the storage
layer to communicate with the underlying storage engine to determine whether to
commit, rollback, or signal a failure. For each new transaction request, the
session manager attaches a transactional context to the session and tracks all
sessions created by the server using a session tracker. Tigris provides support
for two types of transactions.

#### Interactive Transactions

Tigris allows users to perform multi document transactions where they can
execute read and write operations across collections to perform multiple
dependent operations. The user initiates a transaction by submitting a
**BeginTxn** request and controls the transaction state using **Commit** or
**Rollback**. When such transactions are initiated, the session manager
generates a context containing the session ID and the owner's information. All
subsequent operations performed within the transaction will include this
transactional context, which the coordinator uses to determine how to execute
the transaction.

#### Implicit Transactions

Implicit transactions occur when the session manager receives an operation
without any **BeginTxn** request. Although no explicit transaction is initiated,
the operation is still executed within the context of a transaction. The session
manager decides whether to commit or roll back these transactions based on the
operation's response. This means single or multi document operations will always
be performed with ACID properties.

The following example illustrates how easy it is to perform multi document
transactions in Tigris.

```ts title=interactive transactions
await db.transact(async (tx) => {
  // read user 1
  const user1: User | undefined = await users.findOne(
    {
      filter: {
        userId: 1,
      },
    },
    tx
  );

  // read user 2
  const user2: User | undefined = await users.findOne(
    {
      filter: {
        userId: 2,
      },
    },
    tx
  );

  if (user1 === undefined || users2 === undefined) {
    throw new Error("User(s) not found"); // This will auto-rollback transaction
  }

  // deduct balance from user1
  await users.update(
    {
      filter: {
        userId: user1.userId,
      },
      fields: {
        balance: user1.balance - 100,
      },
    },
    tx
  );

  // add balance to user2
  await users.update(
    {
      filter: {
        userId: user2.userId,
      },
      fields: {
        balance: user2.balance + 100,
      },
    },
    tx
  );
});
```

### Concurrency Control

Many systems use the time of acquiring all locks to establish the serial order
among transactions and to guarantee atomicity and isolation. For instance,
[Spanner uses True-time](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi12/osdi12-final-16.pdf)
for determining the commit timestamps when all locks are acquired.
[CockroachDB uses the hybrid-logical clock](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3318464.3386134),
a combination of physical and logical time. Tigris provides lock-free
concurrency control using FoundationDB, combining OCC and MVCC to order
transactions. This is achieved by a sequencer which determines the serial order
by assigning a read version and a commit version to each transaction. Proxies
offer MVCC read versions to clients and orchestrate transaction commits.

## How does it compare to MongoDB Transactions?

A range of tunable read-and-write consistency levels provided by MongoDB can be
advantageous for specific use cases. However, it often leads to confusion for
application developers since it places a responsibility on them to carefully
design their operations and establish the appropriate read-write concerns.
Otherwise, it can result in unforeseeable performance issues or data loss. This
section demonstrates how various operations carry different implications based
on different read-write concerns.

MongoDB's multi document operations, by default, do not have ACID properties,
meaning a single operation can interleave with other operations. MongoDB
provides multi document transactions to address this issue, but these
[transactions can significantly impact performance](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/core/write-operations-atomicity/#multi-document-transactions).
Quoting below from MongoDB's manual:

> In most cases, multi-document transaction incurs a greater performance cost
> over single document writes, and the availability of multi-document
> transactions should not be a replacement for effective schema design.

Similarly, transactions that affect multiple shards can
[significantly impact performance](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions-sharded-clusters/#performance).
Quoting below from MongoDB's manual:

> Transactions that affect multiple shards incur a greater performance cost.

This pushes the complexity to the application developers, who must now
understand the sharding logic and perform operations at the shard level.

The tunable consistency varies for transactional and non-transactional
operations in MongoDB. However, it's important to note that the default
isolation level for non-transactional reads is
[read uncommitted](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/core/read-isolation-consistency-recency/#read-uncommitted),
which means that read operations may see the updated document before the changes
are made durable or committed. To prevent this, a linearizable read concern
guarantees linearizability. But this can result in blocking reads and works only
for read operations with a query filter that uniquely identifies a single
document. Quoting below from
[MongoDB's manual](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/read-concern-linearizable/#performance-comparisons):

> As such, reads with linearizable read concern may be significantly slower than
> reads with "majority" or "local" read concerns‚Äù

## Conclusion

In MongoDB, having a good grasp of read-write concerns and transaction options
is vital. Furthermore, because of the performance implications, you will
frequently end up working around the use of transactions in MongoDB. On the
contrary, Tigris provides serializable multi document ACID transactions by
default, without any additional overhead for cross-shard, cross-collection
transactions, and doesn't require tunable options so that performance is always
predictable and there is no complexity for the application developers. This is
achieved by leveraging the unique architecture of FoundationDB.

We believe developers should not have to bear the responsibility of working
around the use of transactions and complicating their application architectures.
Instead, database systems should provide ACID transactions by default and strong
data consistency mechanics, simplifying the applications and making them more
manageable for developers.
