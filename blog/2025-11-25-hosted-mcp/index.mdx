We’ve made it easier to integrate Tigris into your AI workflows by removing the
most complicated part of getting started with the MCP server: installing it.
This lets you integrate Tigris into your ChatGPT, Claude, and agentic coding
workflows in a snap\!

Here's how you get started:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="chatgpt" label="ChatGPT (web)">
    - Open [ChatGPT Settings](https://chatgpt.com/#settings/Connectors) and click
      "Create" on top right corner of Settings modal
    - In the **Name** field, enter "Tigris"
    - In the MCP Server URL field, enter "https://mcp.storage.dev/mcp"
    - In the **Authentication** field, select "OAuth"
    - Click "Create"
  </TabItem>

<TabItem value="claude-desktop" label="Claude Desktop">
  - Go to Settings \> Connectors - Click on **Add custom connector** button - In
  the **Name** field, enter "Tigris" - In the **Remote MCP server URL** field,
  enter `https://mcp.storage.dev/mcp` - Click "Add" button - Once the connector
  is added, Click on **"Connect"** button and complete the authentication flow.
</TabItem>

  <TabItem value="claude-code" label="Claude Code">

    Run this command:

    ```bash
    claude mcp add --scope user --transport http tigris https://mcp.storage.dev/mcp
    ```

    Then run `claude` use the `/mcp` command to authenticate.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="cursor" label="Cursor">
    Click this button:

    <p>
      <a href="cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=tigris&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5zdG9yYWdlLmRldi9tY3AifQ%3D%3D" className="install-btn">
        <span>Add to Cursor</span>
      </a>
    </p>

    Or run this command:

    ```bash
    npx @tigrisdata/tigris-mcp-server setup cursor
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="openai-codex" label="OpenAI Codex">

    Run this command:

    ```bash
    codex mcp add --url https://mcp.storage.dev/mcp tigris
    ```

    Then run `codex` and use the `/mcp` command to authenticate.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="vscode" label="VS Code">
    1. Press Control+Shift+P or Command+Shift+P to open the command palette.
    2. Search for "MCP: Add Server".
    3. Create a HTTP MCP server.
    4. Enter the URL [`https://mcp.storage.dev/mcp`](https://mcp.storage.dev/mcp).
    5. Name the MCP server `tigris`.
    6. Authenticate with Tigris and get off to work\!
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Why are we doing this?

We want to make it easy for you to use Tigris any way you want: from the CLI,
from the API, from the web, and from your agentic workflows. Hosting a copy of
the Tigris MCP server means that you have even more flexibility when it comes to
using Tigris. It also opens up the ability to use Tigris from the ChatGPT or
Claude web views.

One of the roughest edges of using MCP servers is needing to install and update
the MCP server in order to run it. There’s tricks to this like using `npx` and
running update commands regularly, but one of the easiest ways to eliminate that
entire problem is to not require you to run the MCP server in the first place.
This makes you always have access to the most recent version of the MCP server
and you don’t need to take the risk involved with running software published by
a third party.

Even better, we implemented the MCP OAuth flow. This means you don’t even need
to load API keys into your agent’s configuration, thus reducing the attack
surface. We also took the chance to implement accessing multiple Tigris
organizations at once with this new OAuth flow, meaning that you can get an even
better experience with our hosted MCP server than you got with running the MCP
server locally. If you ask your agent to list buckets, it’ll list them across
all your organizations.

## We need your help

Right now this is an experiment and in a public beta phase. We want to iterate
and make this the best way to access object storage from your agents, but in
order to do that we need your feedback on what you like and don’t like about it.
If things break, please let us know so we can fix it for everyone.

<GetStarted />

Let’s see what we can cook up when we rethink the user experience of object
storage from scratch.

    "Tigris makes it easy to use object storage from anywhere: from the admin console in a browser to the S3 API on your server, and now from any of your AI agents. Tigris makes your storage global out of the box and safe for access from multiple parallel agents with bucket forking."
