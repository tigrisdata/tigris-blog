# Tigris MongoDB alternative now in beta

MongoDB compatibility has been added to the Tigris open source NoSQL database and search
platform and is now also available on Tigris Cloud.

The first beta release of Tigris MongoDB compatibility offers support for MongoDB 6.0+
CRUD and Aggregation operations. Any application that uses the supported MongoDB CRUD
and Aggregation operations, no matter the programming language, can now use Tigris
instead of a self-hosted MongoDB instance or MongoDB Atlas.

## Demonstrating Tigris MongoDB compatibility

CRUD operations for all MongoDB drivers that support MongoDB 6.0+ work with Tigris, so
all you need to do for your MongoDB application to use the Tigris MongoDB compatibility
feature is to update the database connection string.

Let's quickly demonstrate this using the official
[MongoDB TypesScript example](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/mongodb-typescript-example).
The simplest way to follow along is to
[signup for a Tigris Cloud account](https://console.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/signup) and create
your first project, calling it `gamesDB`.

Clone the repo and install the application dependencies:

```tsx
git clone https://github.com/mongodb-developer/mongodb-typescript-example.git
cd mongodb-typescript-example
npm i
```

Copy the `.env.example` file and create a new `.env` file:

```shell
cp env.example .env;
```

Update the `.env` file replacing the contents of the `DB_CONN_STRING` variable with the following:

```tsx
"mongodb://{TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID}:{TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET}@m1k.preview.tigrisdata.cloud:27018?authMechanism=PLAIN&tls=true";
```

Replace `{TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID}` and `{TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET}` within the connection string with the
application credentials from the project you have created in Tigris Cloud. Finally, Update the
value of `DB_NAME` with the name of the project you created in Tigris Cloud (`gamesDB`).

And run the app:

```shell
npm start
```

You'll see output similar to the following:

```shell
[INFO] 15:12:35 ts-node-dev ver. 1.1.8 (using ts-node ver. 9.1.1, typescript ver. 4.3.5)
Successfully connected to database: gamesDB and collection: games
Server started at http://localhost:8080
```

Now, make a few cURL requests to test it out. First, create a resource:

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/games' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
   "name": "Fable Anniversary",
   "price": 4.99,
   "category": "Video Game"
}'
```

Then list the resources:

```shell
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/games'
```

It's that simple! You can check out
[our MongoDB examples on GitHub](https://github.com/tigrisdata-community?q=mongodb-compatibility&type=all&language=&sort=)
for more examples.

## An open source MongoDB alternative

Tigris is an open source alternative to MongoDB. We've released the MongoDB
compatibility feature to make it easier for you to migrate MongoDB applications over to
Tigris and benefit from the following:

- **A truly serverless database**: There's no need for cluster provisioning or
  capacity planning. Create a project, obtain your application keys, and you're
  ready to go.
- **Automatic database sharding**: Tigris provides automatic database sharding, and
  shard keys are unnecessary as the data distribution is automatically handled.
  This includes both sharding and optimizing the number of shards. MongoDB
  requires you to specify and manage sharding to horizontally scale. With Tigris,
  you get more time to focus on developing applications for your users.
- **Cost-efficient and unlimited scalability**: Unlike MongoDB, Tigris, like a
  true NoSQL database, can scale to millions of records read and written per second
  and petabytes of data storage at a fraction of the cost.
- **Strong data consistency**: The storage layer is built on FoundationDB, and
  Tigris inherits the strong consistency guarantees. Tigris provides global,
  interactive, ACID transactions with strict serializability using optimistic
  concurrency control. The strong consistency guarantees coupled with a document-oriented
  database model enable Tigris to support a broad set of workloads.
- **Global secondary indexes:** Tigris offers transactionally consistent global
  secondary indexes allowing quick lookups by any field and enhancing the capabilities of
  the document-oriented database model.
- **Integrated search:** Tigris integrates a NoSQL database, search engine, and
  synchronization mechanism in a unified platform. This provides the fastest way
  to add search capabilities to your applications. Tigris provides a rich query DSL,
  fuzzy search, custom ranking, fast faceting, and geo search.
- **Cloud-native architecture**: Tigris follows a modern composable architecture
  with loosely coupled components. Furthermore, compute is separated from
  storage, allowing for independent scaling and a more resilient system.
- **Bring your own cloud**: Tigris' open source Kubernetes-native design allows it
  to be deployed anywhere in the cloud in your own VPC, so that all the data is
  contained in your own environment.

## How MongoDB compatibility works and what's next

Tigris leverages the FerretDB library to provide compatibility with the wire protocol
for MongoDB, which enables transparent compatibility with native MongoDB client SDKs,
drivers, and tools. Tigris doesn't host the MongoDB database engine. Any
MongoDB client driver compatible with version 6.0+ should be able to connect
with no special configuration. We are actively working on testing the
compatibility with all MongoDB drivers.

![Tigris Architecture](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/assets/images/query-engine-0181798ba58e2e633e223f8a657106fb.jpeg)

We plan to improve compatibility beyond the currently supported CRUD and Aggregation
operations.

For more information, see our
[MongoDB compatibility docs](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/concepts/mongodb-compatibility/).
For details on the Tigris architecture, see our
[Architecture docs](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/concepts/architecture/).

## Beyond MongoDB and MongoDB Atlas

We're excited that the Tigris MongoDB compatibility feature has moved into beta today,
but we have a bigger vision that we're working towards.

With that in mind, we recommend that the
[Tigris SDKs](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdkstools/), not the MongoDB drivers,
are used for greenfield applications or new application features. By doing so, you'll
benefit from the native Tigris functionality, which simplifies the development process
by enabling a code-first and agile approach to database schema definition and removes
the need for an ORM/ODM. In addition, by using the native Tigris SDKs, you will also
benefit from the full value of a modern NoSQL database and search platform.

## Get started with Tigris

The quickest way to try out the Tigris MongoDB compatibility is to signup for a
[Tigris Cloud account](https://console.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/signup) and follow one
of the [Tigris MongoDB compatibility quickstarts](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/quickstarts/mongodb-compatibility/).

If you have any questions or you'd like to contribute to the
[Tigris open source project](https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigris) it would be great to
