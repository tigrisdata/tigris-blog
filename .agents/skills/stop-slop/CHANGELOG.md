# Changelog

## 2026-01-13

### Added

**Phrases (references/phrases.md)**
- Throat-clearing: "Here's what I find interesting", "Here's the problem though"
- Performative emphasis: "creeps in", "I promise", "They exist, I promise"
- Telling instead of showing: "This is genuinely hard", "This is what leadership actually looks like"

**Structures (references/structures.md)**
- Binary contrasts: "Not X. But Y.", "It's not this. It's that.", "stops being X and starts being Y"
- Rhythm patterns: staccato fragmentation, dashes for dramatic pause, hedging as reassurance
- Word patterns: absolute words (always, never, everyone, etc.), AI-overused intensifiers (deeply, truly, fundamentally, inherently, simply, literally, inevitably)
