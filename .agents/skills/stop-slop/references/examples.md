# Before/After Examples

## Example 1: Throat-Clearing + Binary Contrast

**Before:**
> "Here's the thing: building products is hard. Not because the technology is complex. Because people are complex. Let that sink in."

**After:**
> "Building products is hard. Technology is manageable. People aren't."

**Changes:** Removed opener, binary contrast structure, and emphasis crutch. Direct statements.

## Example 2: Filler + Unnecessary Reassurance

**Before:**
> "It turns out that most teams struggle with alignment. The uncomfortable truth is that nobody wants to admit they're confused. And that's okay."

**After:**
> "Teams struggle with alignment. Nobody admits confusion."

**Changes:** Cut hedging ("most"), removed throat-clearing phrases, deleted permission-granting ending.

## Example 3: Business Jargon Stack

**Before:**
> "In today's fast-paced landscape, we need to lean into discomfort and navigate uncertainty with clarity. This matters because your competition isn't waiting."

**After:**
> "Move faster. Your competition is."

**Changes:** Eliminated jargon entirely. Core message in six words.

## Example 4: Dramatic Fragmentation

**Before:**
> "Speed. Quality. Cost. You can only pick two. That's it. That's the tradeoff."

**After:**
> "Speed, quality, cost—pick two."

**Changes:** Single sentence. No performative emphasis.

## Example 5: Rhetorical Setup

**Before:**
> "What if I told you that the best teams don't optimize for productivity? Here's what I mean: they optimize for learning. Think about it."

**After:**
> "The best teams optimize for learning, not productivity."

**Changes:** Direct claim. No rhetorical scaffolding.
