# Structures to Avoid

## Binary Contrasts

These create false drama. State the point directly.

| Pattern                             | Problem                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| "Not because X. Because Y."         | Telegraphed reversal          |
| "[X] isn't the problem. [Y] is."    | Formulaic reframe             |
| "The answer isn't X. It's Y."       | Predictable pivot             |
| "It feels like X. It's actually Y." | Setup/reveal cliche           |
| "The question isn't X. It's Y."     | Rhetorical misdirection       |
| "Not X. But Y."                     | Mechanical contrast           |
| "It's not this. It's that."         | Same formula, different words |
| "stops being X and starts being Y"  | False transformation arc      |

**Instead:** State Y directly. "The problem is Y." "Y matters here."

## Dramatic Fragmentation

Sentence fragments for emphasis read as manufactured profundity.

| Pattern                                  | Problem                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| "[Noun]. That's it. That's the [thing]." | Performative simplicity |
| "X. And Y. And Z."                       | Staccato drama          |
| "This unlocks something. [Word]."        | Artificial revelation   |

**Instead:** Complete sentences. Trust content over presentation.

## Rhetorical Setups

These announce insight rather than deliver it.

| Pattern               | Problem                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| "What if [reframe]?"  | Socratic posturing     |
| "Here's what I mean:" | Redundant preview      |
| "Think about it:"     | Condescending prompt   |
| "And that's okay."    | Unnecessary permission |

**Instead:** Make the point. Let readers draw conclusions.

## Formulaic Constructions

| Pattern                   | Problem                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| "By the time X, I was Y." | Narrative template          |
| "X that isn't Y"          | Indirect. Say "X is broken" |

## Rhythm Patterns

| Pattern                         | Fix                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Three-item lists                | Use two items or one               |
| Questions answered immediately  | Let questions breathe or cut them  |
| Paragraphs starting with "So"   | Start with content                 |
| Sentences starting with "Look," | Remove                             |
| Every paragraph ends punchily   | Vary endings                       |
| Em-dashes before reveals        | Use periods or commas              |
| Staccato fragmentation          | Don't stack short punchy sentences |
| Dashes for dramatic pause       | Use commas or periods              |
| "Not always. Not perfectly."    | Hedging disguised as reassurance   |

## Word Patterns

| Pattern                                                                                            | Problem         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Absolute words (always, never, everyone, everybody, nobody)                                        | False authority |
| AI-overused intensifiers (deeply, truly, fundamentally, inherently, simply, literally, inevitably) | Empty emphasis  |
